When I first began working with scientists
I was puzzled by how little they knew about programming.
I soon realized that they knew far more about it
than I did about galaxy formation,
quantum chemistry,
or protein folding,
and that the principal reason they didn't know more was that
people like me had never taught them.

It took me a longer to understand that
many of the practices I was pushing them to adopt
were a poor fit for their actual problems:
branches in version control aren't designed to manage
dozens of experimental variations on a machine learning algorithm,
and it's hard to write unit tests
when no-one in the world knows what the correct answer is

This tutorial is my latest attempt to teach
a few of the things that I <em>am</em> sure are useful.

## Learner Persona

-   Sabina, 28, has a master's degree in animal physiology
    and now works for a mid-sized veterinary pharmaceutical company.
-   She learned a bit of R in an undergraduate biostatistics course,
    then picked up Python in grad school.
    She spends several hours a week analyzing and visualizing data,
    and is comfortable with basic Git commands.
-   Sabina recently became responsible for maintaining a package
    with over 10,000 lines of Python spread over a hundred source files.
    She believes a better understanding of software design
    will help her debug and extend it.
-   Sabina has tried doing asynchronous online courses a couple of times,
    but strongly prefers learning in real time with other people.
