## The Problem

-   Most research software engineers are self-taught programmers
-   Often have gaps in their knowledge
-   One of those gaps is software design
-   A large program is more than just a dozen small programs
-   Most programming language features exist to manage complexity

## Comprehension

-   Experts understand lower and higher abstraction levels than novices
-   Preferred level shifts with experience
-   Code that is optimal for one reader may not be optimal for another

## How to Learn Design

-   Best way to learn design is from examples
-   These lessons use small versions of common research problems
    -   Generally accessible to people who are programming
    -   Introduce some fundamental ideas in computer science

## Audience

-   Maya has a master's degree in genomics
    -   Knows enough Python to analyze data from her experiments
    -   Struggling to write code other people can use
-   These lessons will teach her how to design, build, and test large programs
    in less time and with less pain

---

## Prerequisites

-   Write Python programs using lists, loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and functions
-   Puzzle through Python programs that use classes and decorators
-   Comfortable writing Unix shell scripts using `for` and wildcards
-   Read and write a little bit of HTML
-   Use Git to save and share files
