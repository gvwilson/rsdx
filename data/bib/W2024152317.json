Within species, the rate of increase of mouth area on weight is usually less than the isometric expectation, in spite of the logarithmic spiral pattern of growth in most species. It is suggested that this deviation is due mainly to changes in density with size. Two species which conform to isometric expectation alter the geometry of the shell as they pow. Between species, the rate of increase in mouth area on weight in adults is much greater than isometric expectation, and the range of mouth areas at standard weight is considerable. These deviations are almost entirely accounted for by differences in shell geometry between large and small species, the former having higher rates of whorl expansion and smaller or nonâ€“existent umbilicuses. The range of loading (weight per unit mouth area) on resting adult snails is thus much less than would be expected. It is suggested that large species are limited in the range of possible shell geometries by the need to minimize loading, while in small species other forces such as desiccation and predation may also be important: the range of geometries is generally larger. Observations on ecology and behaviour tend to support these conclusions."}
