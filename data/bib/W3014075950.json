Unfortunately, the ecosystem is now threatened by mining or tourism activities. However, the impact of that activities on land snail diversity is not well studied. The objective of this study was to inventory the diversity of land snail in limestone karst with focus on their ecological and distribution in Java. Purposive sampling methods using plots (10 x 10 m) were used in 12 different stations in Western Java, Central Java, and Yogyakarta during 2017-2018. Thirty-five species from eleven families of land snail were identified. The highest species richness and population of land snails were found in Watu Blencong (16 species and 158 individuals). Landouria rotatoria distributed in eight locations, while Japonia ciliocinctum (85 individuals) distributed in six locations. Results showed that extended distribution records of ten land snail species were reported. Currently, 63 species of land snails species have been identified in karst ecosystem in Java."}
