Thirty-seven plots were studied along an altitudinal transect reaching from sea level (lowland rain forest) to an altitude of 1,830 m (mossy forest). A total of 1,755 specimens were collected and were assigned to 68 land-snail species. Eleven species were new records for Bioko. At least 15 of the recorded species are endemic to Bioko. The degree of endemism was high in mossy forest (23%) and in lowland rain forest (20%), but lower in montane forest (8%). Species richness showed a hump-shaped distribution along the altitudinal gradient with a maximum at 500 m a.s.l. Species richness peaked in forests in which there had been selective logging more than 50 years ago, indicating that some disturbance may have beneficial effects on biodiversity. Species richness was correlated with the thickness of leaf litter. The availability and quality of suitable microhabitats is more important for the occurrence of snail species than gradients of otherwise often decisive environmental parameters like temperature, which are strongly correlated with altitude. A lack of clustering of the occurrences of different snail species along the altitudinal gradient indicated a Gleasonian meta-community structure with individualistic responses of the various species to environmental parameters. No negative co-occurrence patterns that might provide evidence for interspecific competition could be detected. The frequent coexistence of morphologically similar, and presumably ecologically equivalent, congeneric species may indicate that such equivalents do not exclude each other as predicted by the neutral theory of biodiversity. However, current knowledge about individual snail species is too scanty to exclude the possibility that niches of congeneric species differ in some details."}
