Under controlled conditions sexual maturity may be reached in 28 days and egg laying continues for the greater part of the snail's life. 3. Under good environmental conditions each snail may lay as many as 60 eggs in a single day and a total of more than 3,000 in a life approximately a year. 4. Egg laying occurs during every month and at temperatures as low as 10°C. to 11°C. The incubation period of the egg is related to the atmospheric temperature. 5. The longevity of the snail is likely to be related to its rate of growth and to environmental conditions including periods of drought. 6. The snail remains fully active at temperatures as low at 1.5°C.Sustained temperatures much above 20°C. are unfavourable, temperaturesabove 25°C. proving markedly deleterious."}
