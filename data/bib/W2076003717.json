Subpopulations of C. avenacea on continuous cliffs showed a smaller number of polymorphic RAPD loci and a lower gene diversity (Nei's h = 0.049) than subpopulations on fragmented cliffs (h = 0.078). Genetic distance was not correlated with geographical distance between subpopulations. GST analysis indicated strong isolation effects. Neither the number of polymorphic loci nor Nei's h was correlated with local population density. Our analysis indicates that the local population structure of C. avenacea is a combined result of frequent self-fertilization, genetic drift and low dispersal. Similar findings have been reported in studies on spatial population structure of plants. We suggest that future management actions (selective tree cutting, and controlled access of sport climbers) should also consider small, isolated limestone cliffs to preserve the genetic diversity of C. avenacea."}
