Newly hatched A. arbustorum from different populations (from a lowland forest, a subalpine forest and an alpine pasture in Switzerland) differed significantly in the frequency of cannibalistic attacks on conspecific eggs. The percentage of cannibalistic hatchlings ranged from 50·0% in a subalpine forest to 87·8% in a lowland forest. Two populations were consistent in the proportion of cannibalistic hatchlings over 3 years, while in a third population the proportion of cannibalistic hatchlings varied between years. Hatchlings from populations with a high frequency of cannibals also began to eat eggs at an earlier age. In two populations, the proportion of cannibalistic hatchlings per batch increased over the course of the season, while in a third population the proportion of cannibals per batch was constantly high. Propensity for egg cannibalism was not correlated with absolute egg size, suggesting that the amount of energy and nutrients received during embryonic development did not affect cannibalistic behaviour during the hatchling stage. Differences in the investment in single eggs could explain the inter-population variation in propensity for egg cannibalism in A. arbustorum."}
