Here, we document the new discovery of bioluminescence in four land snails, namely Phuphania crossei, P. globosa, P. carinata, and P. costata. Our observations establish clearly that these four species of Phuphania produce a continuous greenish light from the light-emitting cells located within the mantle and the foot, and that its bright luminescence is intracellular and is not due to any luminous secretion. Although both Quantula and Phuphania can produce a green light, the luminescence patterns are different. The luminescence displayed by Quantula is rhythmical blinking or flashing, while Phuphania glows continuously. In addition, the bioluminescence in Q. weinkauffiana is confirmed, which is similar to that in the related species, Q. striata."}
