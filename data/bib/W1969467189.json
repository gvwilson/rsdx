These snails were injected with morphine or saline vehicle and tested for reaction to an aversive thermal stimulus as part of another study. Mortality levels were monitored over a 2-week period following the initial exposure to the fields and were shown not to be differentially affected by the drug injection procedures. Mortality levels increased linearly as a function of increased length of exposure to the magnetic fields (P < 0.001) but not when exposed to the sham fields. As well, night-time exposures resulted in greater mortality levels than day-time exposures (P < 0.025). These results indicate that day-night rhythms are important in determining the magnitude of the magnetic field exposure effect. It is speculated that the magnetic fields may disrupt endogenous opioid- and calcium-modulated homeostatic mechanisms and augment stress effects, modifying a variety of systems including immunocompetence."}
