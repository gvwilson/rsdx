The study was carried out at a site situated about 880 m above sea level in Styria, in the Gesäuse mountains over two years, using the capture–recapture technique. Population density based on the Jolly–Seber model showed variation ranging from 0.12–4.03 individuals/m2 over the whole study period. The recapture rate after one year was generally high (up to 85% per sampling date). In most cases individuals were aggregated. The snails showed a high site fidelity; average calculated minimum areas were 0.115 m2/day. The sum vector of all individual dispersal observations over the entire study period did not indicate a significant preference for any direction. Only during winter was a significant downhill displacement (possibly passive) detected."}
