Sites sampled were in the Bieszczady National Park, East Carpathians, Poland. Snails were sampled quantitatively at 11 sites located along an elevation gradient in various floristic communities. The estimated population densities varied from 0 to 49 /m2 of forest floor. In a multivariate analysis, the first four axes accounted for 82.7% of variation in recorded environmental variation. The first axis, representing habitat fertility, correlated most strongly with the density of M. tumida. Density of V. turgida showed a weaker correlation with this axis, as it was relatively less abundant in the wettest sites, which were also the most fertile. Multiple regression models were used to determine the effects of single variables: plant species number, herb cover, slope aspect and habitat humidity were the best predictors of the snails' abundance at the sites. The interactions and intercorrelations of these factors are discussed in relation to land snail abundance."}
