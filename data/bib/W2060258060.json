Moreover, 2D-PAGE patterns showed that albumen glands and eggs shared most of the major polypeptide spots.On the basis of the polypeptide mapping methods, all the polypeptides in albumen glands and in eggs were classified into 14 groups. The common polypeptide groups (13 groups of them) in both albumen glands and eggs, that might migrate from albumen glands to eggs during oogenesis, were demonstrated on the polypeptide maps."}
