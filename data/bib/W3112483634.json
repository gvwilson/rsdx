{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909-64.3-4.216", "year": 2020, "abstract": "The lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas (LRGV) contains a unique, subtropical, semiarid floodplain with most of the few remaining Tamaulipan thorn forests in the United States. Less than 2% of Tamaulipan thorn forest remains, with urban and agricultural conversion potentially threatening diverse plant and animal communities native to the habitat. We performed vegetative community surveys and conducted a comprehensive survey of terrestrial snail communities in intact (refugia sites, minimally altered in recent times) and altered (previously cleared and regrown or restored) Tamaulipan thorn forest habitats of the LRGV. In a comparison of intact and altered sites that have comparable vegetation (paired sites), we found that intact sites had a less species-rich snail community than their altered counterparts, but this difference was not statistically significant. This counterintuitive result, in part reflects the fact that the most species-rich, intact snail communities (i.e., Sabal Palm Forest) have no altered (restored or regrown) counterparts and so were not included in the paired comparisons. A nestedness analysis supports this, finding that these unique intact sites, which have the highest species richness and no comparable restored sites, contain the largest pool of species in South Texas. Species richness of snails significantly correlated with a precipitation gradient. A general linear model incorporating mean canopy cover, mean plant height, plant abundance, and plant species richness shows a significant correlation with snail communities. This study is the only comprehensive survey of the snail communities of the lower Rio Grande Valley."}
