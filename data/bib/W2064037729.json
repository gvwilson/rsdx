The periostracum of some pulmonate species is of special taxonomic interest because it bears distinct microscale architectures. Where and how these structures are formed is as yet unknown. Using histological sections through their shells, gelatin cuts, and live observations I studied the pattern by which the periostracal hair‐like projections in two helicoid land snail species are secreted and evenly arranged on the shell. The results indicate a complex mechanism: a hair is formed in the periostracal groove independently of the periostracum, after which it is attached to the edge of the shell, drawn out of the tissue, and finally swivelled to the upper side of the periostracum. Upon further growth of the periostracum, the hairs are finally fixed upright on the shell. J. Morphol. 2011. © 2011 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."}
