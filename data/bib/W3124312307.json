These collections, now at the Natural Museum, Yuriy Fedkovych Chernivtsi National University, were for the most part analysed, but remained partially unpublished. M. Kunytsia used them for regional reconstructions of palaeolandscapes during various stages of the Pleistocene. In our study, we used these collections to assess the land snail diversity in the region during consecutive stages of the Middle and Late Pleistocene. Our analysis of faunas of cold and warm stages showed that the latter were more diverse. While all or most of the cold stages had many species in common, the faunas of the warm stages were more heterogeneous. Such a feature may play an essential role in Quaternary biostratigraphy."}
