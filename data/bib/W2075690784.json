Snail eggs were\r\nstored either in fridge (cold), in a container on a\r\nshelf (ambient) or in earthen pot (earthen) for 1, 2\r\n3 and 4 weeks. Parameters measured were:\r\nexternal (egg length, egg weight, egg circum-\r\nference, egg shape index, percentage egg weight\r\nloss, percentage egg volume loss) and internal\r\n(albumen weight, albumen height and egg pH).\r\nStorage method had no effect on external egg\r\nparameters measured but affected internal\r\nparameters (p<0.001). Length of storage had\r\nsignificant effect (p<0.01) on albumen height, and\r\nweight and volume percentage losses (internal\r\nparameters). Egg weight loss was highest in\r\nearthen pot and lowest in both cold and ambient for\r\nthe first two weeks of storage, thereafter, it\r\nincreases with length of storage. Egg volume loss\r\nwas also found to be highest in earthen pot and\r\nlowest in cold storage. It can be concluded that\r\nroom and cold storage can be used for snail egg\r\n(Archachatina marginata) between 1-2 weeks of\r\nstorage for better egg quality."}
