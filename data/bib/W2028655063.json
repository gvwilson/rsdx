However, not all units of food are equal from a nutritional point of view. A reduced supply of protein and calcium might be critical for the growth, reproduction and survival of herbivorous gastropods. We experimentally examined the effects of different protein and calcium supplies on the growth and survival of the land snail Arianta arbustorum. Groups of snails were reared on agar-based diets with each of three levels of protein and calcium (nine treatments). Snails fed a high-protein diet grew faster and reached adulthood earlier and at a larger adult size than snails fed intermediate-and low-protein diets. Surprisingly, the calcium concentration did not affect shell growth and adult size. Snails reared on intermediate- and low-calcium diets increased their consumption rates, but, despite this compensatory feeding, these snails were unable to take up the amount of calcium required for metabolism and shell growth and had a higher mortality. The calcium deficiency could partly be mitigated by the snails' internal calcium storage and reallocation capacity. A depletion of internal calcium reserves adversely affects the entire nutrient metabolism and was the probable cause for the high mortality rates associated with the intermediate- and low-calcium diets observed in the present study."}
