The patient proved to be sensitized to house-dust mite (HDM) and demonstrated a positive skin test and specific IgE to snail (Eobania vermiculata, Lofarma). The snail RAST was > 80% inhibited by HDM, whereas the mite RAST was < 10% inhibited by snail extract. This is possibly another example of food allergy related to primary sensitization by an aeroallergen."}
