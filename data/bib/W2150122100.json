It is the decrease in the amount of rainfall which induces peak breeding and as a result there is an inverse relationship between the amount of rainfall and the breeding intensity. The evolution of ovoviviparity with the ability to retain eggs and/or young in utero during aestivation is the phenomenon that enables L. martensiana to have peak breeding during the dry seasons. Moisture which enables young to feed and thus grow is an ultimate factor in determining breeding in L. martensiana . The gestation period is 10 to 14 days during the rainy seasons but the snail retains its eggs and/or young in utero during the dry seasons and only deposits them when rain returns. The eggs take 18.6±5.43 days ( N= 130) to hatch after they are laid. Hatching in utero and outside occurs by the young eating the egg shells. Oogenesis in the snails occurs at all times. L. martensiana stores viable allosperms which it can use for further reproduction."}
