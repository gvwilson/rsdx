It is described from a Pleistocene aeolian deposit intercalated between two basaltic lava flows located at Mancha de La Laja (Tenerife Island). The new species is characterized mainly by the presence of two very prominent, spiral, semicylindrical ribs on the body whorl shell. The stratigraphic setting and taphonomic features of the land snail association to which N. lajaensis belongs, were also shown."}
