Some genetic analyses have proved inconclusive, with much variation within populations and apparent gene flow among them. We examined this issue by morphometric and molecular approaches on the morphologically similar species T. coelomphala , T. hispidus and T. striolatus , co‚Äêoccurring in the Alpenvorland of Germany. While these species differed in shell and reproductive system morphology, there were forms that turned out intermediate in shell characters between T. coelomphala and T. hispidus but had genital morphology similar to T. coelomphala . Phylogenetic analysis, however, showed that these forms clustered neither with T. coelomphala nor T. hispidus but are sister to T. striolatus from the same region, which suggests that they evolved by way of sympatric speciation. Further, these analyses suggest that T. coelomphala diverged within T. hispidus ; a crossing experiment indicated that they were interfertile. Expanding the study to include all available Trochulus sequences enabled us to infer evolutionary relationships between them and showed that T. hispidus is polyphyletic. Some Trochulus samples of one nominal species were grouped within others. The combination of phenotypic plasticity and possible mitochondrial DNA introgression illustrates the complex nature of evolutionary processes and the need for caution in the application of traditional taxonomic practice."}
