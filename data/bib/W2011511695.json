Linoleic and linolenic acids resorbed from the diet are introduced into the lipid metabolism, but a major part is degradated to carbon dioxide, negating any obvious sparing effect. 2. 2. Despite the predominance of the linoleic fatty acid series in the snail structural lipids linoleic acid is less effectively incorporated into the phospholipids than is linolenic acid, which may be correlated with the de novo production of linoleic acid in the snail. 3. 3. Linoleic and linolenic acid chains incorporated into the phospholipids are rapidly elongated and dehydrogenated, while in the triglycerides these precursor acids remain metabolically unaltered."}
