Three new species, G. catherina from near Katherine, Northern Territory, G. ningbingia from the Ningbing Ranges north of Kununurra, Western Australia, and G. napierana from the Napier Range east of Derby, Western Australia, are described. The pattern of conchological variation in Gyliotrachela is discussed and the new taxa compared with extralimital forms."}
