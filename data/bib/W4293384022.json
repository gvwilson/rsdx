Observations on single individual and multiple individuals showed similar growth pattern fitted with the von Bertalanffy growth model. A fecundity schedule of the snail was constructed using the daily reproductive outputs of the snails in cohort and in isolated state. The net reproductive rate (R0) and the finite rate of increase (λ) of single individuals (R0 = 124.33 ± 14.67 SE, λ = 1.03 ± 0.003 SE) were lower than the individuals reared in cohort (R0 = 774.55 ± 147.49 SE, λ = 1.115 ± 0.006 SE). The generation time (Tc) of individuals in competition was 107.89 ± 7.92 SE days, while single individuals had longer generation time of 199.39 ± 7.24 SE days. The longevity, the shell size and the shell length, body weight and the fecundity of A. gracile exhibited correspondences as well as provided evidences of the tradeoff in the life history traits. Information on the growth and reproduction of the snail A. gracile will therefore be suitable to assess the life history feature and serves as an input for framing the strategies for its population regulation."}
