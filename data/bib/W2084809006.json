Modelling (Schilthuizen et al., 2007; Craze, 2009) shows that this situation would, under panmixia, lead to equal proportions for dextral and sinistral morphs (true antisymmetry), but population structure will normally drive a bias for the recessive allele. To all intents and purposes, therefore, chiral dimorphism in should be considered a case of genetic antisymmetry. The evidence for the maintenance of chiral dimorphism in derives from studies in a population on the WestMalaysian island of Kapas. This population was discovered by one of us (M.S.) in 1989 and studied intensively since 2003 (Schilthuizen"}
