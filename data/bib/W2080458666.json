This study aimed to produce recombinant &lt;i&gt;Helix aspersa&lt;/i&gt; (brown garden snail) tropomyosin and investigate its implication for cross-reactivity among invertebrates. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; A tropomyosin-specific cDNA encoding &lt;i&gt;H. aspersa&lt;/i&gt; tropomyosin was synthetized, and recombinant allergen was overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; as nonfusion protein. IgE-binding reactivity was studied by immunoblotting and immunoblot inhibition experiments with sera from snail-allergic patients. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Cloned brown garden snail tropomyosin shares high homology with other edible mollusk tropomyosins (84–69% identity) as well as with those from arthropods (65–62%), and less homology with vertebrate ones (56% identity). Tropomyosin reacted with 18% of the sera from patients with snail allergy. Inhibition experiments, using natural and recombinant tropomyosins, showed different degrees of cross-reactivity between invertebrate tropomyosins. Sera from snail-allergic subjects recognized tropomyosins in both mollusks and crustacean extracts. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; Tropomyosin represents a minor allergen in snail extracts, but it is clearly involved in invertebrate cross-reactivity."}
