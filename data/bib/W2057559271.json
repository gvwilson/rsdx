During both non-estivating and estivating conditions, the quantity of heat dissipated per mole of O2 consumed was indicative of a completely aerobic metabolism. This calorimetric-respirometric (C/R) ratio was –461 ±12 kJ mol−1O2 (S.E.M., N=5) under standard non-estivating conditions and –464±26kJmol−1O2 (N=4) during estivation. Respiratory exchange ratios reflected a primary dependence upon carbohydrate as a metabolic substrate during both states. Carbon dioxide retention occurred during the first 36h of estivation, resulting in an increase in hemolymph and a decrease in pH. The respiratory acidosis during short-term estivation was not compensated by elevation of hemolymph [HCO3−] above levels predicted from the in vitro non-bicarbonate buffer value of hemolymph. A brief period of rapid CO2 release, which caused hemolymph and pH to return to pre-estivation values, preceded the increase in O2 consumption during arousal. Exposure of nonestivating snails to 4.67 kPa (1 kPa=7.5mmHg) caused a rapid and fully reversible 50% suppression of respiration rate. The temporal nature of CO2 retention and release during entry into and arousal from estivation, and the suppression of O2 consumption by artificial hypercapnia, support the hypothesis that elevated or the resultant acidosis may contribute to metabolic suppression during estivation by land snails."}
