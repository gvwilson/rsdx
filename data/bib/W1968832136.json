Of the 350 A. marginata examined, 209 (59.7%) were infected with a mean worm load of 27.2 larvae per snail. Similarly, 221 (61.1%) of 362 A. achatina examined had larvae of P. cantonensis with an intensity of 38.1 larvae per snail. The prevalence of Parastrongyliasis increased significantly with snail size (age) in both snails. There were seasonal fluctuations of infection intensities in both snails with peak intensities occurring during the rainy season, 43.9 larvae per snail in July and 55.8 larvae per snail in August for A. marginata and A. achatina respectively. The involvement of P. cantonensis in some diseases of man is highlighted.
