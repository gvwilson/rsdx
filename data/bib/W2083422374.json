The feeding value of some of these snails has been assessed [2] but there is a dearth of information on the fatty acid and cholesterol contents of the most important ones, except for the report on A. maginata [3]. This paper provides information about this topic, especially on three of the most prominent and widely utilized giant land snail species in W. Africa, using some popular animal protein sources such as fish and broiler meat as reference."}
