The data concerning land snails (Stylommatophora) are especially contradictory. By using two model species of stylommatophoran mollusks, Brephulopsis cylindrica (Menke, 1828) and Xeropicta derbentina (Krynicki, 1836), we conducted a long-term observation of their copulatory behavior in Southern Ukraine. In X. derbentina , a clear pattern of the positive assortative mating with respect to body size was found, whereas assortative mating in relation to shell banding polymorphism was revealed in 2 cases out of 7. B. cylindrica snails copulate with any available mate partner, regardless of its size."}
