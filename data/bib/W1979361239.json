In this study, the use of refuges by Iberus gualtieranus gualtieranus and Sphincterochila candidissima is compared. These two species belong to families with different distribution ranges, but they live in sympatry on a mountain in southern Spain with a dry Mediterranean climate. I. g. gualtieranus used mainly rock crevices as refuges, consistently throughout the year. S. candidissima hibernated beneath humus during autumn and winter (I. g. gualtieranus did not hibernate). In spring, S. candidissima seemed active, while I. g. gualtieranus was already aestivating. In summer, S. candidissima aestivated on vegetation, while I. gualtieranus aestivated deep within crevices. These differences in the use of refuges may be explained on the basis of the need for more protection by I. g. gualtieranus because of its morphology, which is less suited to the dry habitat, but has evolved to enable this species to exploit karstic crevices as refuges more efficiently. These results illustrate that behaviour and morphology interact allowing both species to coexist in sympatry in an arid environment using different adaptive strategies."}
