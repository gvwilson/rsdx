Previous studies have revealed that radulae can be adapted to the food or the substrate the food lies on, but the real, in vivo forces exerted by this organ on substrates and the stresses that are transmitted by the teeth are unknown. Here, we relate physical properties of the radular teeth of Cornu aspersum (Müller. 1774 Vermium terrestrium et fluviatilium, seu animalium infusoriorum, helminthicorum, et testaceorum, non marinorum, succincta historia. Volumen alterum . Heineck &amp; Faber, Havniæ &amp; Lipsiæ.), a large land snail, with experiments revealing their radula scratching force. The radula motion was recorded with high-speed video, and the contact area between tooth cusps and the substrate was calculated. Forces were measured in all directions; highest forces (106.91 mN) were exerted while scratching, second highest forces while pulling the radula upwards and pressing the food against its counter bearing, the jaw, because the main ingesta disaggregation takes place during those two processes. Nanoindentation revealed that the tooth hardness and elasticity in this species are comparable to wood. The teeth are softer than some of their ingesta, but since the small contact area of the tooth cusps (227 µm 2 ) transmits high local pressure (4698.7 bar) on the ingesta surface, harder material can still be cut or pierced with abrasion. This method measuring the forces produced by the radula during feeding could be used in further experiments on gastropods for better understanding functions and adaptations of radulae to ingesta or substrate, and hence, gastropods speciation and evolution."}
