{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1079/cpc.26821.20210104463", "year": 2021, "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> <italic>C. aspersum</italic>, the common garden snail, is represented by several forms that are highly differentiated genetically. Only one lineage, the western one, is considered to be invasive in regions where it has been introduced recently (since the sixteenth century) either accidentally or intentionally (e.g. North and South America, South Africa, Oceania). It was in California, USA, where it was introduced in the 1850s, that it was first treated (1931) as a regulated pest. Its success in colonizing new areas after introduction and establishment may be due to: (i) large phenotypic variation in combinations of life-history traits, especially reflecting a high degree of plasticity (e.g. trade-off of egg weight/egg number), and (ii) great resistance against natural enemies. Also, genetic data indicate that <italic>C. aspersum</italic> is capable of establishing even after a severe genetic bottleneck."}
