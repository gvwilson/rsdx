Males have a rectilinear relationship between weight-adjusted oxygen consumption and temperature. Females have a curvilinear relationship. 3. There was a significant sexual difference in the relationship of weight-adjusted oxygen consumption and temperature, with the mean value for males being higher than for females at 22 and 27Â°C. 4. Q10 values for males decreased with increasing temperature, and for females they increased with increasing temperature. 5. Metabolic rate (Vo2) of V. contectoides is dependent on pH, with two pH optima at pHs 7.1 and 8.9 with an intervening trough."}
