{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-4983.00184", "year": 2001, "abstract": "An unusual trochiform gastropod, Semizona bella gen. et sp. nov., is described from the Boda Limestone carbonate mounds (upper Ordovician, Ashgill) of central Sweden. A second species, S. glindmeyeri (Rohr, 1996), is recognised from the Ordovician (Whiterockian) of Nevada. The shell shape and the strongly prosocline tangential aperture of Semizona suggest that balancing of the shell on the head‐foot mass was accomplished by tilting of the axis of coiling of the shell to about 65 degrees with 10–30 degrees of regulatory detorsion. The rounded aperture allowed straight contraction of the retractor muscles, suggesting clamping behaviour often associated with a sedate, grazing snail. This agrees with the environmental setting, which suggests a hard substrate with rich microbial growth. Besides clamping, the subsutural nodes and thick shell were probably effective against predation; repaired injuries indicate failed predatory attacks. Semizona shows morphological similarities with some pleurotomariin vetigastropods, and with the family Pseudophoridae Miller, 1889."}
