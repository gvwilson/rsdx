{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.70.4.1186", "year": 1973, "abstract": "The pulmonate land snail Rumina decollata in its native Mediterranean range is a complex of monogenic or weakly polygenic strains generated by a breeding system of facultative self-fertilization. One strain colonized North America and now occupies much of the southern United States and northern Mexico. No genetic variation within or among populations in the United States was detected in an electrophoretic analysis of proteins encoded by 25 loci. These findings emphasize the potential for adaptive convergence in the genetic systems of hermaphroditic animals and plants."}
