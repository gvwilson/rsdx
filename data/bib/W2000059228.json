It was found that IK activation kinetics may be congruent with the Hodgkin-Huxley scheme if one assumes that the proportion of n particles at the beginning of the pulse is not zero. In this case IK activation may be treated as carried by a homogeneous channel population, which may be relevant in view of the reported heterogeneity of the inactivation phase of this current."}
