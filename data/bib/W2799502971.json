The recorded species mainly belong to the class Gastropoda (9 families, 8 genera, 8 species), which provide important information about the prevailing ecology during the periods of habitation and usage of the cave by Late Chalcolithic and Medieval inhabitants. The archaeological and zoological evidence could suggest a possible occurrence of rodents and birds, which are predators feeding on land mollusks. Finally, snail assemblages of Areni-1 cave suggest, that the climate regimes, vegetation and environment are similar to the present."}
