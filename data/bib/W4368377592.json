The snails previously treated as subspecies or synonyms of Oospiragracilior and Oospiramagna are reclassified and recognized as distinct species. The lectotype of Oospirainsignis has been clarified and an illustration of the original type specimen provided. A long-overlooked species, Oospiraandersoniana, has been collected and redescribed herein. Two new species from the limestone karsts in the Salween River Basin are introduced: Oospiraluneainopsis Man & Panha, sp. nov. and Oospirazediopsis Man & Panha, sp. nov. A synoptic view of all clausiliid taxa known from Myanmar is presented along with taxonomic information and distributional records. Photographs of the type materials for all taxa are provided for further comparison or, if unavailable, photographs of the examined specimens or the original figure from the literature."}
