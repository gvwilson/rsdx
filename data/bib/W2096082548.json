This study analyses the use of shells from the arid-dwelling land snail Sphincterochila candidissima (Draparnaud 1801) by arthropods in the Sierra Elvira (south-eastern Spain). Arthropods of 11 different orders occupied 15.6% of shells. Salticidae (54.6%) and Apoidea (21.3%) comprised the majority of arthropods. Shells were used primarily when environmental temperatures were lowest, suggesting that, in the Sierra Elvira, arthropods use shells to escape from the cold. Weather explained 73% of the variation in shell occupation. However, Apoidea used shells independently of weather, occupying shells as nesting chambers. These results suggest that snail shells may be important refugia and nesting sites for arthropod fauna."}
