{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2012.06.008", "year": 2012, "abstract": "Abstract Shells of the helicid Cepaea nemoralis were studied using taphonomic, isotopic and morphometric measurements to estimate late glacial–Holocene (~ 12.1–6.3 cal ka BP) environmental conditions in northern Spain. Higher taphonomic alteration among Holocene shells suggests lower sedimentation rates or higher shell-destruction rates than during glacial conditions. Shells preserved the aragonitic composition despite differing degree of skeleton damage. Shell δ 13 C values were − 10.3 ± 1.1‰, − 8.2 ± 2.3‰, and − 7.3 ± 1.6‰ for modern, Holocene and late-glacial individuals, respectively. Higher δ 13 C values during the late-glacial and some Holocene periods imply higher water stress of C 3 plants and/or higher limestone contribution than today. Intrashell δ 13 C values were higher during juvenile stages suggesting higher limestone ingestion to promote shell growth. Shell δ 18 O values were − 1.1 ± 0.7‰, − 0.9 ± 0.8‰ and − 0.1 ± 0.7‰ for modern, Holocene and late-glacial specimens, respectively. A snail flux-balance model suggests that during ~ 12.1 − 10.9 cal ka BP conditions were drier and became wetter at ~ 8.4 − 6.3 cal ka BP and today. Intrashell δ 18 O profiles reveal that glacial individuals experienced more extreme seasonality than interglacial shells, despite possible larger hibernation periods. Shell size correlated positively with δ 18 O values, suggesting that growth rates and ultimate adult size of C. nemoralis may respond to climate fluctuation in northern Spain."}
