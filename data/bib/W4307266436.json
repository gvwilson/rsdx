Several synanthropic gastropods are invasive in urban and agricultural environments worldwide. In Saudi Arabia, increased human activities have accelerated the introduction of terrestrial gastropod species, increasing the need to study its gastropod fauna. Our preliminary survey disclosed the presence of ariophantid snails in a number of agricultural nurseries. Based on morphological features of shell, body, and reproductive system, we report the first record of Macrochlamys indica from Saudi Arabia. The phylogenetic analysis obtained from DNA sequences of the mitochondrial COI and 16S regions confirmed the identity of M. indica. One third of the investigated nurseries were infested with this snail, however, we did not find any specimens of M. indica in natural habitats or open agricultural fields. The snail-infested nurseries were distributed all over Saudi Arabia. The occurrence of one haplotype of partial mitochondrial COI sequence from these nurseries suggests that the introduction of M. indica is likely very recent. Based on the obtained results, it is recommended that control measurements must be implemented in order to eradicate or at least restrict the dissemination of M. indica from nurseries to natural habitats or agricultural fields."}
