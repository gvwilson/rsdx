This study was a comprehensive inventory of terrestrial mollusks in Knox County, Tennessee; an area within the Valley and Ridge physiographic region rich in calcareous soils and bluffs. Knox County supports a total of 151 species, including 70 newly reported to the county and 15 newly reported to Tennessee. Sixteen species non-native to North America were found, mostly in urban/ residential habitats. Limestone/sandstone bluffs were found to have the highest diversity of terrestrial mollusks."}
