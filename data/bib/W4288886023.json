With the temperature being a reliable indicator of the seasonal changes, an attempt to explore the variations in the life history strategies of the pest snail Allopeas gracile (Hutton, 1834) (Gastropoda: Subulinidae) was carried out under four constant temperature grades - 15°C, 20°C, 30°C and 35°C (±1°C) temperatures throughout with laboratory temperature as controlled environment. The snail A. gracile was unable to complete their life cycle at 15°C and 20°C, without reaching reproductive maturity. In contrast, A. gracile maintained at laboratory temperatures (range 25-29 °C) exhibited long life span, longer reproductive period and longer generation time. However, the reproductive rate was highest at temperature 30°C. Perhaps, the warmer environment facilitated rapid growth, fast onset of reproduction with larger body size at early age. At a constant higher temperature of 35°C a state of inactivation was imposed when growth and reproduction became static. Apparently, the expression of the life history traits of A. gracile was supportive of an invasive nature, at a temperature ranging between 25°C and 35°C."}
