Marking and recapture of individual snails showed that linear growth of the shell ceased when a lip was formed around the outer margin of the aperture. Measurements of snails suggested that increase in outer lip width was a good indication of age, but that the rate of lip thickening varied between populations. Large Placostylus showed a restricted range of movement. Both tagging studies and random sampling revealed that mortality was size specific. Most small snails (<60 mm shell length) located were dead, whereas most larger snails were alive. Population densities of living snails averaged 2.2 individuals per 0.25 m2 in the study area. The local distribution was patchy owing to the tendency of snails to be associated with specific features of the vegetation."}
