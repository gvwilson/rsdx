This is one of the few snails that people have purposely introduced into their gardens. Several populations are now established in Kentucky, including a newly discovered population in Kenton County. The bright, striped or solid, yellow, pink, and brown shells of this species have long caught the eyes of natural historians and biologists. Populations of these snails are classic model systems for ecological genetics studies. While introduced populations of wood snails seem to have had only minor impact as agricultural pests, they may have the potential to competitively exclude some native species of snails."}
