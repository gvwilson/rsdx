To acquire information for comparative analysis of gastropod life cycles, we conducted experimental breeding of three viviparous clausiliids from Japan and Taiwan. Under laboratory conditions, Tauphaedusa sheridani (Pfeiffer, 1866), T. tau (O. Boettger, 1877) and Stereophaedusa (Breviphaedusa) jacobiana (Pilsbry, 1902) featured similar times to complete shell growth (12-16 weeks), age of first reproduction (23-24 weeks) and annual fecundity (143- 173 neonates per pair of snails). The maximum number of eggs retained in genital tract reaches nine for T. sheridani, 11 for T. tau, and seven for S. jacobiana. The ratio between average shell height of neonate and adult varied between 13.5% for T. tau, 13.9% for T. sheridani, and 16.7% for S. jacobiana. All species were able to self-fertilize. Exposure to long drought affects intrauterine embryo development in all species; additionally, it results in parent and embryo mortality in S. jacobiana. Observed differences in the structure of the egg envelope among studied species point to greater than expected differentiation of developmental processes in viviparous Phaedusinae of East Asia."}
