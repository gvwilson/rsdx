{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.3853/j.2201-4349.72.2020.1759", "year": 2020, "abstract": "The systematic taxonomy of three currently accepted species of Austrochloritis Pilsbry, 1891 from central eastern New South Wales (A. nundinalis Iredale, 1943, A. niangala Shea & Griffiths, 2010, and A. kaputarensis Stanisic, 2010) is revised based on comparative morpho-anatomy and mitochondrial phylogenetics. In addition, the status of two undescribed candidate taxa identified as Austrochloritis spp. NE3 and SN39, respectively, is assessed. These species and candidate species are closely related to the type species of the genus, Austrochloritis porteri (Cox, 1866) from southern Queensland based on a recently published mitochondrial phylogeny."}
