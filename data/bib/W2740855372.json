Results revealed the toxic effect of all tested pesticide baits with mortality percentage increasing with an increase in the period of exposure. It was evident that deltamethrin belonging to pyrethroid group exceeded other pesticides and showed high initial toxicity of 70.0% and 93.3% against M. cantiana and E. vermiculata, respectively after three days of exposure. However, methomyl belonging to carbamate group surpassed other pesticides and gave 100.0% mortality after seven and 12 days for the two land snails, M. cantiana and E. vermiculata, respectively . On the other hand, chlorpyrifos-ethyl exhibited the lowest mortality percentages against the tested land snails. Obviously, methomyl proved to be the most effective pesticides followed by deltamethrin, bensultap, lambda-cyhalothrin, diazonixy then chlorpyrifos-ethyl against the two land snails. Moreover, the brown garden snail, E. vermiculata showed more sensitivity to the tested pesticides especially methomyl and deltamethrin than"}
