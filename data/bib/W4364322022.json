Proliferation phase involving fibroblasts is one of important step-on wound healing. Use of drugs such as povidone iodine on cuts aims to accelerate wound healing is still being debated. Healing by land snailsâ€™ mucus can be an alternative because it has many benefits. This study wants to know about the influence of land snailsâ€™ mucus on the number of fibroblasts in healing cuts.Design and methods: The study is an experimental research with post test only randomized control group design. The subjects were 18 Mus musculus strain mice that were divided into 3 groups. 1st group as a control group of untreated, 2nd group was given povidone iodine 10%, and 3rd group was given land snailsâ€™ mucus during 5th days. On the 6th day the mices were killed for histological study.Results: The data showed that average number of fibroblast in 1st group is 93,85; 2nd group is 126,37; and 3rd is group 217,5. The results of one way anova statistical test showed significant difference among the three groups p = 0,000. The results of post hoc test showed significant difference in all groups (p &lt; 0,05).Conclusion: The mucus of land snail is influence the number of fibroblast in healing cuts (Sains Medika, 4(2):195-203)."}
