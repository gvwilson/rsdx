More than half the studied species are at some level of danger of extinction, and about 20% of the species are now extinct. All the threats to these snails come from human interference in Galápagos landscapes. Population growth has had many knock-on effects on the islands’ ecosystems. Much of the growth in the year-round human population has been driven by a burgeoning tourist industry, which went from a few thousand visitors a year before World War II to almost a quarter of a million visitors in 2019. Habitat loss and invasive species have already driven many species to extinction. The land snail fauna has been devastated by introduced insects such as the little fire ant and the tropical fire ant. The invasive giant African land snail has devoured the natural vegetation that has served as food for land snails, as have feral goats, donkeys, and pigs. Finally, the New Guinea flatworm is poised to become a highly dangerous predator of Galápagos land snails as it spreads eastward across the Pacific islands. For many Galápagos snail species, the main hope for the future may lie in captive breeding."}
