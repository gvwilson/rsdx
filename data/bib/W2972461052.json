The larvae of an unknown species, tentatively named as Brachylaima sp. B (Trematoda: Brachylaimidae), have been found from Euhadra brandtii sapporo in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan. In this study, a large-scale snail survey covering a wide area of Japan was conducted to confirm the larval parasite from members of Euhadra and related genera. Sporocysts with cercariae were found only from Eu. brandtii sapporo in Hokkaido and Euhadra callizona in central Honshu at low prevalence (1.0–9.6%). The metacercariae were detected widely from 6 species of Euhadra and the related genera at high prevalence (7.1–100%). A molecular identification by DNA barcoding demonstrated almost all of the larvae to be Brachylaima sp. B. Adult worms experimentally raised from the metacercariae were morphologically most similar to Brachylaima ezohelicis in Hokkaido, but could be differentiated by the microstructure of the tegumental surface. We propose Brachylaima lignieuhadrae n. sp. for the unknown species, based on the morphology, DNA profile, host specificity, and geographic distribution. Phylogeography of the new species suggests a possibility that migratory birds serve as the definitive hosts."}
