We recorded the species in 2015 and 2017 in the municipalities of Santos and S&atilde;o Vicente in the metropolitan region of Baixada Santista, S&atilde;o Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. We found the species in an urban park and in a secondary forest altered by exotic plants. As this species is considered a pest and is capable of transmitting disease to humans, we propose that urgent measures be taken by the Brazilian government to control its populations."}
