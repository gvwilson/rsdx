{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/0300-9629(94)90055-8", "year": 1994, "abstract": "Common garden snails Helix aspersa Müller were subjected to 3 weeks of desiccation at 20°C and 80% rh, during which the water content of the foot declined from an average of 85% in well hydrated individuals, to 80.7% of wet weight. In the same time, hemolymph osmolarity varied from 154 to 219 mOsmol/l. There is a highly significant correlation between these two variables, osmolarity being inversely related to foot water volume, suggesting that extra- and intracellular fluids are in osmotic equilibrium. No active snail had a blood osmolarity higher than 80mOsmol/l and no quiescent snail had one lower than 186mOsmol/l. During progressive dehydration, the heart rate declined to about 63% of the initial rate."}
