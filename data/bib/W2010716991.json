{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.4314/tv.v24i1-2.4580", "year": 2008, "abstract": "The growth performance and haemolymph biochemical value of the African giant land snail Archachatina marginata fed ad-libitum with pawpaw leaves and reared under different stocking densities were investigated in an eight-week experiment. Four different stocking densities of 5, 10, 15 and 20 snails per cage (0.5m x0.5mx0.2m) were used with each group replicated. The cage with 15 snails per cage recorded the best growth performance viz-a-viz-weight gain, shell length gain as well shell circumference gain, while treatment IV, stocked at 20 snails per cage recorded the least growth performance. There is a strong relationship between stocking density and the concentration of the haemolymph protein (40.9g/l, 24.5g/l, 35.5g/l and 19.1g/l for treatment I-IV respectively), glucose and lipids. However, there was no difference in the concentration of the mineral elements across the stocking densities. Keywords: A.marginata, stocking density, haemolymph, biochemical value.
