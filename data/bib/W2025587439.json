{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1139/z89-385", "year": 1989, "abstract": "The shell color and banding polymorphism of the land snail Cepaea nemoralis has been the subject of numerous ecological studies. Evidence is presented in this paper that differences in opioid modulation of thermal responses are associated with this shell polymorphism. It is shown that the effects of the prototypic opiate agonist, morphine, and prototypic antagonist, naloxone, on the aversive thermal (\"nociceptive\") responses of Cepaea vary with shell banding pattern and thermal micro-habitat. Of the three morphs examined, the shell type (yellow unbanded) with the highest basal response latency and morphine-induced \"analgesia\" was present at the warmest environmental temperatures, the shell type (yellow two-banded) with an intermediate basal response latency and morphine-induced analgesia was at sites of intermediate temperature, and the shell type (yellow five-banded) with the shortest response latency and lowest morphine sensitivity was present in the coolest micro-habitats. It is suggested that these differences in opioid modulation of thermal responses may contribute to the polymorphic thermal responses of natural populations of Cepaea."}
