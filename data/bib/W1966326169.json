The growth performance was measured by body weight gain, shell length gain and shell circumference gain while the measured haemolymph metabolites were glucose, protein, lipids, Na+, K+ ,Ca2+, Cl- and PO42-. Normal snail recorded better growth performance and growth rate (3.432x) than albino snails (2.166x). Similarly significantly higher (P 0.05) was recorded in the concentrations of minerals of the two snails species haemolymph. The domestication of the two snail ecotypes is thus recommended for heliculturist.Keyword: Albino snails, Archachatina marginata, biochemical value, haemolymph."}
