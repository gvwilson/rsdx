Purposely introducer in the country in 1988 for human food purposes (continental malacoculture), this species ended up being officially banned later in 2003, triggering hasty public actions, directly involving the “unprepared” Brazilian population through the means of social communication, aimed at their control and eradication of the environment. Consequence of this procedure, premature and alarmist, today many species of native and endemic terrestrial snails, poorly known scientifically, are under increased threat of extinction situation in Brazil and, very probably, in other South American countries."}
