These investigations were performed using six lowland populations living in central France (alt. 206-282 m) and five highland populations, located in the Massif central (alt. 806-900 m). The survival rate of G. truncatula after flooding dried soil with water was significantly higher in the highland than in the lowland populations (69.5-80.7 % in road ditches, for example, instead of 29.3-33.0%). The mean shell heights of surviving snails and the durations of snail re-activation in water did not show any significant variation, whatever the origin of snail population. The percentages of snails buried in drying soil were higher in the highland population (13.0 % and 15.0 % of juvenile snails, for example, instead of 4.0 % and 7.7 % in lowland snails). In the lowland population only young snails buried, whereas 5.8-8.3 % of adults in the highland population were partially burrowing. The local climate of the sites studied in the Massif central, and the ability of snails to burrow into the mud when stagnant water disappeared in July, might explain the higher survival rate during aestivation."}
