Topsoil pH and calcium content were determined for each of 39 sites. The objectives were to study the effects of these habitat characteristics on snail density, species richness and quantitative structure of the land snail assemblages. With one exception, no significant relationships between soil pH (as a proxy for Ca supply) and the total numbers of individuals and species at the four site categories were observed. Snail density and species richness on groundwater soils, represented by rarely mown sedge stands and regularly mown meadows, were clearly higher than on intermediate moisture soils (as defined by the climatic water balance) of regularly mown meadows, indicating that soil moisture was the most important factor accounting for these differences. Furthermore, we observed specific conditions associated with the presence of trees in the category of meadow orchards on intermediate moisture soils. There, numbers of individuals and species were significantly higher than in the meadows on intermediate moisture soils. A posteriori cluster analysis of quantitative similarity of all snail assemblages showed that soil moisture accounts for the major differences between the site categories with respect to snail density, species richness and quantitative composition of the grassland snail assemblages. As these results are in contrast to the findings of many woodland studies, we suggest that the occurrence or abundance of certain species in the site categories are explained by land management, especially by frequent disturbances at the soil surface caused by mowing."}
