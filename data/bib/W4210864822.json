In 2013, a survey of the forests in western Malalak District of West Sumatra located a new population on Bukit Pandan, which is described herein as Amphidromus (Goniodromus) bulowi malalakensis new subspecies. The new subspecies has a dextral whitish shell with a pale grey and/or light buff to tawny open-tent pattern instead of brown, and lacks the creamy, purplish- or pinkish-brown undertones of the amphidromine nominotypical subspecies."}
