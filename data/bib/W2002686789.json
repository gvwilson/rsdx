The age of the samples (approximately 10,500 14 C yr B.P.) suggests that the decrease in δ 18 O may manifest climatic changes associated with the Younger Dryas. Some combination of increased relative humidity and cooler temperatures with decreased δ 18 O of precipitation during the times of snail activity can explain the decrease in shell δ 18 O. A well-known Paleoindian bison kill occurred at the Folsom site during this inferred environmental transition. Average δ 13 C values of the aragonite shells of the fossil Vallonia range from −7.3 to −6.0‰ among different archaeological levels and are not as negative as modern values. This suggests that the proportion of C 4 vegetation at the Folsom site approximately 10,500 14 C yr B.P. was greater than at present; a result which is consistent with other evidence for higher proportions of C 4 plants in the region at that time."}
