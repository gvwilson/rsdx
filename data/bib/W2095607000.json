{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0030605306000810", "year": 2006, "abstract": "This paper describes the distribution, population size and conservation needs of the land snail Gulella taitensis (Gastropoda: Streptaxidae) endemic to the Taita Hills, Kenya. The species was investigated using timed searches between July and December 2000. In total 37 snails were recorded from only five of nine forest fragments searched. The snail was generally more abundant in the smaller forest fragments. The species appears to be a forest specialist, exhibiting preference for the least disturbed sections of forest. The small population size, restricted distribution and concentration in the smallest and most fragile forest fragments suggests the species is on the brink of extinction. The species fulfills the requirements for changing its conservation status from Endangered to Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Promotion of the Forest Reserves to a conservation category that provides greater legal protection is necessary."}
