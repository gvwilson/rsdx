The obtained results revealed that, the tested 'pesticides meted substantial lethal effect-against the two species alter seven days Post- treatment as mortality percentages that increased with Increasing the concentration value and the dis-atien of emosse. M. awful:ow were more sensitive towards the tested pesticides than E. yen/Nadas , at laboratory, 7- days / L60 values for H. cartasiana wee, 474, 6329, 13612 and 17028 ppm when heated vAh nemacur, *bayed, 9211= and aniseed respedively. The corresponding values for E vennladala were, 24199, 91622, 69403 and 169392 ppm. The same trend was nearly observed when these compounds were applied against the two species under fled conditions, the population reducbco percentages after seven days post- treatment were 89.3, 73.8, 29.7 and 25.0 for H. cazystana treated with lebaycid, nemacur, senor and antracol respectively. The corresponding values for E vennkulatawere, 25.0, 20.0, 49.0 and 15.0 for E. vmmeilati treated with lebaycid, nemaos, savor and antracol respectively. According to the obtained results, it could be recommended by applying, nemacur, tebaycid, sencor and antracol as molluscickles among the integrated pest management (IPM ) programs."}
