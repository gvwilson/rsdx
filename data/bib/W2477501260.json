Analysis of the amounts and D/L ratios of amino acids in Bowden land snails indicates that some of the material is actually of late Holocene age. Only four species can confidently be assigned stratigraphically to the Bowden shell bed; all are extinct, but most belong to extant species groups endemic to the island. The Bowden fauna provides a glimpse of the Jamaican land snail fauna 60 to 80% of..."}
