Results showed that the mean levels of Cr (399 ± 195 mg/kg) and Se (51.6 ± 31.3 mg/kg) were significantly higher (P Se > Pb > Cd > As > Hg. The results showed that As and Hg fell within their permissible safe levels; but Cd, Cr, Pb and Se were significantly above safe levels for human consumption. The high concentration of trace metals in the snail samples may be related to anthropogenic activities taking place in the areas studied."}
