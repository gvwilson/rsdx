{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/0305-0491(94)90189-9", "year": 1994, "abstract": "The kinetic properties of pyruvate kinase (PK) from the ventricles of early and prolonged estivated and hibernated land snails, Helix lucorum, were studied. The kinetic properties of PK from the ventricles of snails acclimated to cold for 4 days and 2 months were also determined. Short estivation (4 days) converted the PK to a less active form, possibly via enzyme phosphorylation. After 2 months of estivation, PK exhibited kinetic properties similar to control enzyme, except that the Vmax increased about 2-fold, indicating metabolic reorganization. During early and prolonged hibernation, the kinetic properties of PK did not change significantly. The results indicate that low temperature and low pH may be the main modulators of enzyme activity in the ventricle of H. lucorum during hibernation."}
