By means of cluster analysis it appears that lakes may be divided into four groups on the basis of snail species composition. The lakes of the four groups show a spatial distribution which is related to topographical differences, terrestrial vegetation and land use. Snails may be divided on the basis of water hardness into hard water species and calcium indifferent species or into demanding and modest/indifferent species when clustering is based on presence/absence."}
