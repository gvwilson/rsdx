The demographic analysis of the populations of B. fruticum revealed that a) two cohorts exist in the field throughout the year b) the reproductive period started in the beginning of summer and c) growth was increased during spring and autumn. According to von Bertallanffy' method B. fruticum needs 5 years to attain its maximum size in the field of 25.40 mm. Mortality rate increases and life expectancy decreases with increasing age. Net reproductive rate (Ro) was equal to 3. 15 and per capita rate of increase (rc) was equal to 1. Annual secondary production, calculated by Hynes' size frequency method, revealed a mean annual density of 5.9 individuals/m2, a mean standing crop (B) of 8.09 g/m2/year and an annual production (P) of 1.92 Â± 0.11g/m2/year. Annual turnover ratio (P/B) was equal to 2.37."}
