In 28-day ecotoxicity tests, H. aspersa juveniles were exposed to increasing concentrations of Pb or Cd. EC50s, concentrations reducing snail growth by 50%, differed between the soils and so did Cd and Pb uptake in the snails. For lead, EC50s were 2397–6357 mg Pb/kg dry soil, while they ranged between 327 and 910 mg Cd/kg dry soil for cadmium. Toxicity and metal uptake were highest on the soil with the lowest pH, organic matter content and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). Growth reduction was correlated with metal accumulation levels in the snails’ soft body, and differences in toxicity between the soils decreased when EC50s were expressed on the basis of internal metal concentrations in the snails. These results confirm the effect of soil properties; pH, CEC, OM content, on the uptake and growth effect of Pb and Cd in H. aspersa, indicating the importance of properly characterizing soils when assessing the environmental risk of metal contaminated sites."}
