The aim of the study was to assess the histological reaction of C. aspersum’s immune system against A. abstrusus. Sixty-five snails were provided by a snail farm. Five of them were digested to assess the absence of natural parasitic infections. The remaining sixty were divided into five groups. Three groups of snails were infected with A. abstrusus using by-contact or injection methods; one group was injected only with saline solution and one group was left untreated as the control. The snails of group A were sacrificed and digested on study days 2, 10, and 18; snails of the other groups were collected and examined for histopathological analysis on study days 2, 10, and 18. On study day 2, in the infected snails, several free L1s were observed along with the absence of immune system reactions. On day 10, the L2s elicited an intense reaction in the internal layer of the muscular foot. On day 18, all L3s partially encapsulated by the snail’s immune system were observed in the outermost part of the muscular foot, which is near and among the goblet cells. This last finding suggests that L3s could be shed with the snail’s mucus and spread in the environment, representing an alternative route of transmission for this feline lungworm."}
