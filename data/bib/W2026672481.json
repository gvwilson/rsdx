In the first, a localized modern population represents the hybrid descendants of a 13,000-year-old fossil form from the same area, introgressed with the modern form now characteristic of the adjacent regions. In the second case, a chronocline spanning 15,000 to 20,000 years and expressing the transition of an extinct fossil form to the modern form found on the south coast was documented by morphometry of fossils dated by amino acid racemization and radiocarbon. Hybrid intermediates persisted for many thousands of years."}
