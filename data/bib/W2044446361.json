Because of their limited ability for dispersal, land snails live in colonies which are often subjected to a strong local differentiation. For fragmented agricultural habitats, in which frequent and severe bottlenecks occur, the successful colonization by Helix aspersa suggests an organization of colonies in semiisolated demes (metapopulation). 1 In order to investigate the structure of the genetic variability among natural populations of H. aspersa located in an anthropic environment, autocorrelation statistics were used to analyze the spatial isozyme differentiation in 14 sampled populations along a transect in the polders of the bay of Mont-Saint-Mi chel, Western Brittany (Fig. 1). From an initial survey based on 12 enzymatic systems, the most polymorphic loci (Lap-2, Aat-1 and Est-3) were retained to be tested for autocorrelation. Electrophoresis techniques used are described in detail in Guiller et al . 2"}
