Compared with 100 year-old data the number of species has remained relatively constant. A species turnover ratio of 0.16 % year-1 was calculated for the whole area. The species-area regression equation gave a z-value of 0.321. The high z-value, the low turnover ratio and a variance to mean ratio of 2.29 are interpreted as an effect of the relative remoteness of the islands. It is suggested that snails colonized the islands via brackish waters, which are gradually cut off by land upheaval. The highest number of species occur in young lakes recently isolated from the brackish Baltic Sea, while at higher elevations the number of species declines."}
