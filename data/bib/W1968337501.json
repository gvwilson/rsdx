Purine-N, as uric acid, xanthine and guanine, accounts for over 70 per cent of the total N present in the kidney contents (excreta) of Strophocheilus oblongus. Of three other major invertebrate excretory products, urea, NH4+ and amino acids, only the latter two were present, but their contribution to the total N was only 0Â·2 per cent. 2. Uric acid and NH4+ were also present in the blood of Strophocheilus; no urea was detected in the one specimen examined. 3. Strophocheilus is thus similar in its excretory N metabolism to other terrestrial pulmonates."}
