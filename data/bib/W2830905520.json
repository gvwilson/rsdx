In the present study, we review a first group of minute land snail species belonging to the genus Georissa (Gastropoda, Hydrocenidae) from Malaysian Borneo. This group is restricted to the species with conspicuous scale-like sculpture on the shell. Based on materials from recent fieldwork, museums, and personal collections, Malaysian Borneo hydrocenids are more complex and diverse in shell characters than previously anticipated. Here, a molecular, conchological, and biogeographic study of this \"scaly group\" is presented. We recognise 13 species of which six are new to science, namely Georissa anyiensissp. n., Georissa muluensissp. n., Georissa bauensissp. n., Georissa silaburensissp. n., Georissa kinabatanganensissp. n., and Georissa sepulutensissp. n."}
