{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.238782", "year": 2022, "abstract": "The transfer of male accessory gland secretions is a well-investigated reproductive strategy for winning in sexual selection. An example of such a strategy is the conspicuous mating behaviour of simultaneously hermaphroditic land snails, the so-called shooting of love darts, whereby a snail drives a love dart(s) into the body of its mating partner. In the land snail Euhadra quaesita, it has been shown that a specific mucus which coats the love dart is transferred into the partner's haemolymph and that it suppresses subsequent matings in the darted individual. However, how the mucus of the love dart suppresses rematings remains unclear. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that by injection of the dart mucus, love-dart shooters manipulate the physiology of a dart recipient and make the individual sexually inactive. In an experiment in which snails were provided with opportunities to encounter a potential mating partner, we found that the latency period to achieve sexual arousal was longer in snails injected with the dart mucus than in snails of the control treatments. This finding indicates that the dart mucus delays sexual arousal in injected snails. This delay in arousal is a novel example of the effects of the mucus in simultaneously hermaphroditic land snails. The remating suppression effect of the dart mucus is likely to occur through sexual inactivation."}
