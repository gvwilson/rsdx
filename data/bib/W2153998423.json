Four experimental diets A (Paw paw leaves), B (maize bran) C (guinea corn bran) and D (Plantain peels) were used for the study. Proximate analysis of the diets showed that diets B (maize bran) and C (Guinea corn bran) were high in protein and mineral contents while diets A had the least value Growth parameters (weight gain, shell length gain shell circumference gain) were determined. The result of the study showed that higher growth performance for all parameters for Archachatina marginata was favoured by guinea corn bran (diet C) while paw-paw leaves (diet A) had the least for all the parameters. There was significant difference in (P 0.05) in shell circumference of the snails fed with the experimental diets.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tKey words:  Giant land snail, growth performance, diets."}
