The snails were anesthetized with magnesium chloride, were removed from their shells, and their digestive glands were disrupted. The disrupted parts were examined under a microscope.In Van Province, H. lucorum snails were found to be intermediate hosts for Dicrocoelium trematodes with a prevalence of 22%. The larval stages detected in the microscope are photographed and shown in detail. The number of infection with larval stages of the parasite was found to be highest in May.Helix lucorum the land snail, serves as an intermediate host for some developmental stages of the Dicrocoeliid trematodes, is also consumed as nutrients by humans in some countries. Based on the obtained results in this study, it can be concluded that this snail would have important effects on animal health in the Van region which has a hard climate and a border with Iran."}
