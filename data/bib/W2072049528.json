{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2008.11.005", "year": 2008, "abstract": "Allozyme variation was examined in 223 samples of the operculate land snail Cyclophorus fulguratus from 13 localities across three regions of Thailand. Using horizontal starch gel electrophoresis, 13 allozyme presumed loci (12 polymorphic) were screened. Heterozygosity was moderate in C. fulguratus (Hexp = 0.008–0.127) with a high genetic heterogeneity among samples (Fst = 0.734). Populations showed a greater genetic differentiation in central Thailand (Fst = 0.380) than in northeastern Thailand (Fst = 0.108), suggesting frequent gene flow among populations in northeastern Thailand. C. fulguratus exhibits a strong pattern of isolation by distance over the entire tested species range in Thailand and may potentially have been involved in an extensive local fragmentation. Results of the distance analysis revealed that large genetic divergence has occurred among the central, northeastern and eastern Thailand groups [D = 0.361–0.701], strongly suggesting populations from these three geographical regions may actually represent or else be evolving into separate species."}
