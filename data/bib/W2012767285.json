{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01650521.2013.843910", "year": 2013, "abstract": "AbstractIn the present study we report the first record of the western European terrestrial snail Oxychilus alliarius (Miller, 1822) for continental Chile. Oxychilus alliarius is known for its highly predatory and invasive behavior, being directly associated with the decline of native snail populations in places where it has been introduced. Continental Chile has, on the other hand, the highest generic and specific endemism known for Punctoidea in the American continent, most of them potential prey for O. alliarius. The different species of Oxychilus are easily misidentified because of their conchological similarity. To overcome misidentification, we analyzed both morphological and molecular data which should enable the unambiguous identification of O. alliarius. In order to engage and facilitate further studies we describe and illustrate characters of the radula, shell, and present molecular data of O. alliarius, which are useful and necessary for distinguishing O. alliarius from its sister species.Keywords: Oxychilus alliariusmolluscabiological invasionradulaemolecular identificationChile AcknowledgmentsFJC thanks Dr. Fernando Marques (Departamento de Zoologia-IB-USP) for facilities at the Molecular Systematic Laboratory; to the San Ignacio del Huinay Foundation for a fellowship, logistic support and for allowing the study of their fauna; to Gabriela Avendaño for her help in collecting the specimens; and to Jéssica Gillung (Departamento de Zoologia-IB-USP) for her assistance with the shell photography.
