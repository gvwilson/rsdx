Six constant temperatures between 3 and 18dÌ€C and four levels of relative humidities between 34 and 98% were maintained. A light regime of 16 h light: 8 h dark was used. There are highly significant differences in activity at different levels of adaptation temperature and relative humidity. The interaction between these factors is significant. There are no significant differences in nocturnal activity between the two phenotypic shell colours nor between the two age classes, but the interaction between morph and relative humidity is significant. The interaction between age classes and relative humidity is also significant. Yellows are more active than browns at high humidities, but less active at low. They are therefore likely to be behaviourally more responsive than browns in an environment of fluctuating humidities. This result is discussed in relation to the maintenance of the polymorphism."}
