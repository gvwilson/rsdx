The principal objective of this study was to examine the specific predator responsiveness of the firefly larvae against the giant African snails under experimental conditions. This was evaluated using two (2) treatments T1 and T2. T1 investigated giant African snail neonates of size 0.5 cm with a larva to snail ratio of 1:5. In T2, larvae to snail ratio of 3:1 was investigated using 2 cm giant African snail neonates. Control treatments were included in the experimental design with the absence of the larvae. Each treatment was replicated five (5) times. There were 100 % mortality effects for T1 and T2. Commonalities existed in both the spatial and the temporal characteristics to possibly consider the firefly larvae as an idealistic and highly compatible predator for the giant African snail neonates. Ecological engineering strategies to encourage the presence of the firefly will aid in suppressing the giant African snail population. The study concludes that the firefly larvae can be a possible predator for the control of the giant African snail once the firefly populations are encouraged in both crop and non-crop spaces."}
