{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1139/z00-030", "year": 2000, "abstract": "Mantle-collar tissue from adult land snails Otala lactea continuously incorporated labelled amino acids over a 72-h period of incubation in modified culture medium. Acid-saline extract of cerebral ganglia stimulated protein synthesis by the mantle-collar tissue in vitro. This effect was dose-dependent, with the minimum and maximum doses at 0.5 and 2 cerebral ganglion equivalents, respectively. The protein synthesis-stimulating factor(s) from the cerebral ganglia appeared to be proteinaceous and hydrophobic in nature. The cerebral ganglion extract was fractionated by means of a size-exclusion HPLC column. The biological activity was induced by three fractions with estimated molecular masses of 0.82, 1.88, and 4.33 kilodaltons (kDa). Porcine insulin antiserum abolished the activity of the 4.33- and 1.88-kDa fractions but had no significant effect on the activity of the 0.82-kDa fraction. The results suggest the existence in the cerebral ganglia of more than one factor with protein synthesis-stimulating activity. One of these factors could be related to mammalian insulin. Porcine insulin, however, had no significant effect on protein synthesis by the mantle collar in vitro."}
