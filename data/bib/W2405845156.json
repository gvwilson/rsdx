Many snails are alternately exposed to air and submerged in water on tidal cycles and are subject to a highly variable and often rapidly changing temperature regime. Annual air temperature ranged from 0.5–39 °C within the tidal reaches of the study areas. The organically enriched Heathcote River populations were dominated by large individuals during all months, whereas in the rural Taranaki Stream, high proportions of small and large snails were present on most sampling occasions. Population density at the latter site averaged about 16,000 m−2 and was highest in winter. Although growth could not be inferred from size frequency data, laboratory rearing of snails indicated that individuals would reach full size in less than a year. Mature snails at all sites were primarily females (mean ratio 1.4:1). The egg of P. estuarinus is described and the incidence of trematode larvae, principally metacercarial cysts of an unidentified species, is reported."}
