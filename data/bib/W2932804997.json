Analyses of shell colour and banding polymorphism revealed distinctive patterns of variation. While the frequency of brown shells showed a clear geographical pattern related to climate, other morphs showed no such clear trends. Variation among populations was great, but little of this could be accounted for by variation among regions. Spatial autocorrelation was generally restricted to very short distances, of the order of 20 km or less. Variation with habitat was found in the form of an excess of brown shells in shaded habitats and an excess of yellow and yellow effectively unbanded shells in open habitats, although this was not universal. The data suggest that cases of long-distance, passive dispersal followed by more local spread account for much of the variation, and that strong selection related to habitat may be obscured by different sources of populations within a few kilometres of each other. The data are now available to track changes over time."}
