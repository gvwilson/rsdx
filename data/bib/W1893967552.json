From sampling at nine locations, twenty-one land snail species from eleven gastropod families were found. Of these, eight species are non-native and two of these Parmarion martensi Simroth, 1893 and Quantula striata (Gray, 1834) (Ariophantidae) are new records for the Rotuma Group. Ten of the 13 species of native land snails found — including the endemic partulid Partula leefi E. A. Smith, 1897 and the rhytidid Delos gardineri (E. A. Smith, 1897) — were detected only as empty shells. The native Ouagapia perryi (E. A. Smith, 1897) and the endemic Succinea rotumana E. A. Smith, 1897 and Sinployea rotumana (E. A. Smith, 1897) remain undetected on Rotuma Island since their first collection in 1897. The non-native, invasive predatory flatworm, Platydemus manokwari, was also found and represents a major threat to the island’s land snail fauna. This non-native species appears to be absent in many other parts of the Fiji Island archipelago and thus a re-evaluation of existing quarantine measures is required to address its potential spread to non-invaded areas. Comparisons with earlier surveys indicate a shift in the structure of the Rotuman land snail fauna over a 115-year period, with declining native components and increasing prevalence of non-native species. Further sampling, focusing on residual native habitat in less accessible areas such as coastal cliffs and offshore islets, is urgently needed to establish the conservation status of Rotuman native land snails and determine the threat posed by both, non-native snails and P. manokwari."}
