The snail was fed weekly for 15 months on four types of food (lettuce, potato, apple and carrot) and chalk provided, hence an opportunity to select for food. Juvenile snails showed greater selectivity depending on whether the food was needed for somatic growth or reproduction. On the other hand, when fed exclusively on one each of the same food items and given no opportunity to choose, the snails grew better on the same food items they selected in the choice experiment. The absorption efficiencies (AD) were high, the utilisation efficiency (ECI) was 1–13% and showed distinct peaks corresponding to egg production. Values for ECD were 1.25–15.5%. Variation in growth rates was due mainly to utilisation efficiencies of the four foods tested. Large amounts of chalk were eaten during the period of somatic growth and greatly reduced during the reproductive phase of L. flammea. The significance of these findings to the snails ecology is discussed."}
