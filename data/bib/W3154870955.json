Results of these studies showed reduction of the percentage of glucose in aestivation periods compared with the period of activity, where the concentration of glucose in the activity revealed 52.63 mg / dL, compared with an average concentration in aestivation, reaching 16.16 mg / dL. Regarding the concentration of protein, it observed a decrease in aestivation period compared with activity period, where it reached 3.39 g / dL in the activity period compared with 1.9 g / dL in aestivation. In case of urea the opposite results were recorded, where the urea concentration in the period of activity was 5.97 mg / dL compared with 7.89 mg / dL in aestivation. The results of histochemical studies indicated the presence of large amounts of carbohydrates in the cells of the digestive gland as well as in the cells of foot in the previous of aestivation. Moreover the study showed that the snail consumed large amounts of carbohydrates during aestivation period."}
