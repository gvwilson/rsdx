The edible parts of the snail (Archachatina marginata) and beef and their pies were analysed using standard methods. The beef and beef pies served as controls. The snail and its pie had higher (p < 0.5) values for protein and iron than beef and its pie. The snail pie was preferred (p < 0.5) by the judges (school-age children and young mothers) over meat pie in terms of appearance, texture, taste and flavour. The snail pie is recommended as a cheap source of protein and iron for school-age children and young mothers and could contribute in the fight against iron deficiency anaemia."}
