Condonella McLellan, 1927, is assigned to Eucalodiidae and interpreted as a flat-coiling member of a clade in which most members are high-spired and cylindrical. Straparollus lens Gabb, 1864, from the Chico Formation (Campanian) in central California, USA, is recognized as a pulmonate land snail and assigned to Megomphicidae. A second megomphicid species from the Chico Formation, Polygyroidea hiltoni, is described as new."}
