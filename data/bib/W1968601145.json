{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s10739-007-9145-5", "year": 2007, "abstract": "Biologists and philosophers have been extremely pessimistic about the possibility of demonstrating random drift in nature, particularly when it comes to distinguishing random drift from natural selection. However, examination of a historical case – Maxime Lamotte’s study of natural populations of the land snail, Cepaea nemoralis in the 1950s – shows that while some pessimism is warranted, it has been overstated. Indeed, by describing a unique signature for drift and showing that this signature obtained in the populations under study, Lamotte was able to make a good case for a significant role for␣drift. It may be difficult to disentangle the causes of drift and selection acting in a population, but it is not (always) impossible."}
