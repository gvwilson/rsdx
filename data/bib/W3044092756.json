There is especially a lack of studies involving invertebrate organisms. We studied the repeatability of the standard metabolic rate (SMR) and the effect of individual variation in SMR on the subsequent winter survival in a terrestrial shell-bearing mollusc, the white-lipped snail (Cepaea hortensis) in mid-Norway. SMR was measured twice during the autumn and - after an experimental overwintering at controlled conditions - twice during the following spring. We found a significant repeatability of SMR over all three time periods tested, with a clear effect of time, with a high repeatability of 0.53 over 4â¯days during spring, 0.44 over 12â¯days in the autumn and 0.23 over 194â¯days from autumn to spring. That SMR is a repeatable physiological trait across the winter period during which a possible selection might occur, suggests that SMR could be a potential target of natural selection. We indeed found that the autumn SMR significantly influenced the probability of survival during the winter period, with a combination of a positive linear (Pâ¯=â¯.011) and a quadratic stabilizing (Pâ¯=â¯.001) effect on SMR. Our results hence support the view that metabolic rate is an important physiological component influencing the fitness of an organism."}
