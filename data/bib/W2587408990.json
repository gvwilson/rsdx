Through analysis of 4,471 land snail individuals, in which 833 individuals were collected in 102 quantitative sites, the results showed that there were 25 species, classified into 20 genera, 12 families, 2 subclasses. Among these species, 2 species were firstly found in Vietnam (Quirosella knudseni Clench, 1958; Pleurodiscus balmei (Potiez & Michaud, 1838)), 9 species were firstly found in Mekong Delta (Vietnam) and 6 taxa were unidentified to species the scientific name. The subclass Pulmonata had the most various species (76%) and the families Cyclophoridae and Camaenidea had the most numerous species (5 species). The distribution area of land snails in the islands of Kien Hai district, Kien Giang province seemed to be more similar to surrounding nations than that in the North of Vietnam. Species composition, diversity index and density of snail were found to decrease as going from near to far islands with respect to the mainland. Cyclotus fasciatus Von Martens, 1864 and Quantula striata (Gray, 1834) were the dominant species."}
