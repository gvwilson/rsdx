It is presented in the form of individual fact sheets, which include the main identification criteria, geographical distribution and principal ecological traits. Terrestrial gastropods are represented by three species belonging to the same order, a tiny autochtonous land snail and two introduced slugs. Two species of Agriolimacidae have been identified on the ÃŽles Kerguelen. These two species include: Deroceras invadens and Deroceras reticulatum. The chapter also presents distribution maps of introduced species and provides a discussion on the originality and vulnerability of this fauna."}
