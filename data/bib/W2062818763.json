Generally, abundant carbohydrate and protein materials were detected in the component cells of the digestive gland of normally feeding snails. The results of this investigation revealed a pronounced decline of carbohydrates in the digestive gland cells of Monacha cartusiana snails after starvation. Severe decline in carbohydrate content was observed especially after 30 days of starvation. Moreover, protein inclusions have exhibited a week stainability in the digestive gland cells of these snails as a consequence of starvation."}
