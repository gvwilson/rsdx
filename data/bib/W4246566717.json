The malacophagous carabid Damaster blaptoides shows two extreme morphologies in the forebody; there is an elongate small‐headed type and a stout large‐headed type. A feeding experiment showed that the small‐headed type obtained a high feeding performance on snails with a thick shell and a large aperture by penetrating the shell with its head. In contrast, the large‐headed type showed a high feeding performance on snails that had a thin shell and a small aperture, and they ate these prey by crushing the shell. The large‐headed, strong‐jawed beetles are efficient at shell crushing but are ineffective at shell entry; the large mandibles and musculature that allow for shell crushing make the beetle’s head too wide to penetrate shell apertures. On the other hand, small‐headed, weak‐jawed beetles crush poorly but can reach into shells for direct predation on snail bodies. These findings are hypothesized to be functional trade‐offs between force and fit due to morphological constraints. This trade‐off would be a primary mechanism affecting both resource handling ability in animals and phenotypic diversity in predators and prey."}
