Thus, it can be used as a model group for understanding migration and differentiation processes in the Southern Alps. We generated genome-wide double digest Restriction Site Associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing data for 166 specimens from 36 populations of the door snail Charpentieria itala and for 8 specimens of the other three Charpentieria species to reconstruct their evolutionary history and phylogeography. Phylogenetic and structure analyses based on the ddRAD data indicated that the repeated separation of the populations in western and eastern groups by the Garda glacier during the glacials was the process that most strongly shaped the population structure of C. itala. This process may also explain a similar phylogeographic boundary in many other southern Alpine animal and plant species. Our study revealed that some populations that resemble Charpentieria stenzii morphologically and ecologically, the ‘stenzioid’ subspecies, originated by a hybridization event with Charpentieria stenzii. A further hybridization event between stenzioid populations that survived the glacials in mountain refuges and non-stenzioid populations that probably came into contact with stenzioid populations as a result of climate warming during an interglacial resulted in the origin of a hybrid subspecies that is adapted to intermediate altitudes. Our study demonstrated that the origin of new differentiated taxa by hybridization, is more frequent than previously assumed."}
