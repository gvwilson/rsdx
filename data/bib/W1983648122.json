This polymorphism has been related to predatory effects as well as climatic reasons, assuming that dark morphs benefit from being more cryptic and therefore less prone to predation, whereas pale morphs are at an advantage under solar radiation, as they are suspected to heat up less. However, the assumption of different thermal capacities of these morphs is based on experiments with little standardisation or little environmental relevance. In this study, we aimed at measuring thermal capacities of two different morphs (pale versus dark-brown banded) of the Mediterranean land snail Theba pisana, applying a standardised and environmentally relevant test set-up, in order to prove whether darker morphs indeed do heat up more than lighter coloured morphs. We did not find any differences in the thermal capacity of the different morphs and conclude that thermal capacity of the shell is predominantly defined by its material rather than its coloration. These results are discussed with regard to previous studies on thermal characteristics of different land snail morphs and correlations between climate and morph distribution."}
