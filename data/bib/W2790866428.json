Each treatment was randomly assigned to one of the experimental feed with variable protein levels (20, 22 and 24%) in addition to pawpaw leaves as a staple feed. These were previously weighed as well as the remnants using a 0.5g precision balance. The cultured substrates were watered daily (0.50 liter/substrate). At the beginning of the test, and then every week, the snails were weighed, and shell measurements done using a digital caliper of 0.05 mm accuracy. The animals were monitored for fourteen months. The results show that feed intake (3.01±1.57), weight gain (24.50±5.72), daily weight gain (0.058±0.016), gain of shell length (30.26±4.19) were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in snails receiving 24% protein in the diet compared to snails from the other treatments. The highest consumption index was recorded in snails receiving 20% protein in the diet but the statistical analyses did not find any significant difference. In conclusion, the protein level of 24% can be retained in the diet of growing snails."}
