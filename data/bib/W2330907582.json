It is characterized by an unusually hairy shell for the genus and a short, dimpled verge. It is related to Sonorella sitiens sitiens Pilsbry and Ferriss, 1915, and S. sitiens montezuma Pilsbry and Ferris, 1919, by its short verge and to Sonorella magdalenensis (Stearns, 1890) by its vaginal collar."}
