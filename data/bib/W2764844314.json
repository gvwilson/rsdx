Approaches to data presentation are discussed, assessing the merit of presenting absolute and relative abundance of shells; and detailing methods for representing change through time in vertical sequences of samples. Ordination methods which may be used to explore lateral variation between samples, and the concept of taxocenes, are discussed, along with the use of various measures of diversity and their implications for interpreting taphonomy. Finally, metrical variation within and between collections of single species are explored as palaeoenvironmental proxies, and methods for extrapolating climate data from land snails evaluated."}
