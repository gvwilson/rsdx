However, these mutations could persist in the population as polymorphisms when it is advantageous for the individuals carrying them in adapting to a specific external environment. We tested this hypothesis using the dimorphic land snail Euhadra peliomphala simodae in Japan; these snails have dark or bright coloured shells. The survival rate of dark snails at hatching was lower than that of the bright ones, as observed in the F1 progenies produced through crossing. Dark snails have a congenital fitness-disadvantageous mutation; however, they also have protection against ultraviolet radiation. They have a higher survival rate than the bright snails in a UV environment, as observed using the UV exposure experiments and UV transmittance measurements. This is a good example of a congenitally disadvantageous mutation that is advantageous for adapting to the external environment. These results explain the maintenance of polymorphism and highlight the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in the wild population."}
