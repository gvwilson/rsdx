The current fauna of the islands is 19 species, 16 from Rakata, 12 from Sertung, 7 from Panjang and 1 from Anak Krakatau, the latter being the first record of a land snail from that island. Six species are recorded for the first time from the Krakatau Islands. These are Filicaulis bleekerii, Pupisoma orcula, Elasmias sundanum, Lamellidea ( Lamellidea) subcylindrica, Microcystina gratilla and Landouria rotatoria. Radulae of several of the species are figured. The expeditions produced 19 new records for individual islands."}
