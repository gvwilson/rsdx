Although 39 generic taxa have been proposed for Japanese clausiliids, the generic classifications are problematic. We performed a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of Japanese clausiliids based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences to test traditional morphology-based systems. All Japanese taxa, except for Mundiphaedusa miyoshii, and most Taiwanese taxa constituted a large clade, which is subdivided into seven clades. Phylogenetic relationships among and within the seven clades are largely discordant with the traditional systems. Frequent parallel evolution was also revealed in all taxonomically important characters including CA morphology. Despite the notable discordance between morphology and molecular phylogeny, some tree topologies recovered by this study are congruent with biogeography. As similar phylogeographic patterns have been reported in European clausiliids, local speciations associated with frequent homoplasy may be a dominant pattern of clausiliid evolution. A new system of generic and subgeneric classification of Japanese and related Taiwanese clausiliids is proposed with description of five new generic taxa: Changphaedusa gen. nov., Solitariphaedusa gen. nov., Dimphaedusa subgen. nov., Taiwanphaedusa subgen. nov., and Tyrannophaedusoides subgen. nov."}
