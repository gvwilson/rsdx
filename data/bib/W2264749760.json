Mollusc samples were taken with the installation of two quadrants of 2.00 Ã— 2.00 meters, where there was the presence of animals in five installments (urban land) in each neighborhood. Individuals were collected by manual capture with an effort of 2 hours per plot/sampler and then weighed and measured. Questionnaires were administered to residents of each neighborhood order to know their perception towards the African snail. The results indicated a significant population growth, with 419 molluscs identified as A. fulica in the three neighborhoods of the city of Santana. Growth was higher in the center and Paradise neighborhoods, being observed in these two districts the care of cleaning the property was poor, enabling the installation of molluscs. The information reported by residents interviewed indicated that the level of education of the same, as well as its hygienic practices was related to the occurrence and abundance of the species under study. In the Amazon Village neighborhood, the abundance and occurrence were smaller and not different in past study. It became apparent that residents with higher education levels were those which kept hygienic with their property, which directly influenced the non-installation of alien species, contributing indirectly with the environment."}
