They are easy to collect and mark, and because of their limited power of dispersal and their generally patchy distribution, snails exhibit extensive demographic and genetic population structure even on a microgeographic scale (Baur 1993). As one major group of land snails, several species of the family Helicidae are adapted to grassland ecosystems. Small land snails of the sub-family Helicellinae especially prefer habitats of dry open grassland with sparse vegetation. In Germany, habitat of this type is generated and maintained mainly by agricultural use, especially sheep grazing and viticulture. In the course of structural changes in agriculture during the last decades, sheep grazing has nearly vanished, and former grasslands and vineyards have either turned into intensively used monocultures or have been abandoned. This has led to a substantial loss of habitat due to natural succession and has resulted in progressive fragmentation and isolation (Henle & Kaule 1991). Thus, several snail species are endangered in Germany (Jungbluth 1986, Bogon 1990, Körnig 1992). We therefore focussed our research on two Helicellinae snails, Trochoidea geyeri (SOOS, 1926) and Candidula unifasciata (POIRET, 1801). Both species are rare today in Germany and are considered to be extinct in several states (Bundesländer). In the present case study, we analyse the population structure of T. geyeri and C. unifasciata in different grassland ecosystems: firstly, in the agricultural landscape near Halle (Bliss et al. this volume: 161–168), and secondly, in an abandoned vineyard complex on a limestone hill in the upper Kinzig valley (Hesse, Germany) with characteristic dry grassland on calciferous soil."}
