Various techniques have been applied to elucidate pore structure of avian egg shells, including fracturing coupled with scanning electron microscopy and differential histochemical staining of the matrix. The best results reported have thus far been from plastic impregnated, etched specimens (Board & Tullett, 1974). The present report is a modification of this latter technique, utilizing the very low viscosity, highly penetrating electron microscopic embedding medium developed by Spurr (1969). This modification is used in this report of the previously undescribed pores from the egg shells of the giant South American land snail, Strophocheilus oblongus. These eggs, which can be up to 50 mm in length, have recently been investigated with respect to the calcium carbonate mineralogy (Tompa, 1976) as well as with respect to the matrix biochemistry Tompa et al., 1977). (Similar resin has been used successfully for the plastic impregnation and ultrathin sectioning of that region of the snail shell where the body muscles insert into the shell comumella (Tompa & Watabe, 1976).) This technique, which can be utilized on avian eggs or on any other calcified material in probing for pores, relies on the high penetrating ability of the resin as well as on its easy commercial availability around the world."}
