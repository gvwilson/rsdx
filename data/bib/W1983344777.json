Only 9% of the inoculated 1st-stage larvae (400 ± 20 per snail) were recovered from the large snails as compared to 25% from the medium and small snails. Of the exposed small snails, however, only 35% survived to the end of the experiment (33 days post-infection) as compared to a 97.5% and 98% survival rates for the same period in the medium and large adult snails, respectively."}
