The soluble basal uterus enzyme oxidizes a broad range of substrates. The enzyme reveals two pH optima, showing one peak at acidic range (pH 5.5) and another at alkaline range (pH 9.0), suggesting multiplicity. Electrophoretic analysis confirms the multiple nature of the enzyme and there are differences in the oxidizability of various substrates by different fractions. Based on the effect of chemicals it is suggested that phenoloxidase contains tyrosyl and sulphydryl groups. The results are discussed in relation to sclerotization."}
