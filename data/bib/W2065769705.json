We provide the first description of tool use in great antshrikes ( Taraba major ), which were observed using stone anvils to break the shells of the land snail ( Achatina fulica ). This behavior is almost certainly of extremely recent origin given the lack of previous reports of tool use in T. major and the very recent (1980s) introduction of A. fulica into Brazil. Tool use in this particular population is probably a flexible behavioral trait that arose in response to the high density of exotic snails in this locality."}
