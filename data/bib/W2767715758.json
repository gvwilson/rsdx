{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-15758-y", "year": 2017, "abstract": "Abstract The phylogeographic structure of the land snail Camaena cicatricosa was analyzed in this study based on mitochondrial gene ( COI and 16srRNA , mt DNA) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) sequences in 347 individuals. This snail is the vector of the zoonotic food-borne parasite Angiostrongylus cantonensis and one of the main harmful snails distributed exclusively in China. The results revealed significant fixation indices of genetic differentiation and high gene flow between most populations except several populations. An isolation-by-distance test showed no significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance among C. cicatricosa populations, which suggested that gene flow was not restricted by distance. The levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity of C. cicatricosa were generally high, except those in some special populations, according to the mt DNA and ITS2 data. Furthermore, the phylogenetic trees and asteroid networks of haplotypes indicated nonobvious genetic structure, the same as results got based on the synonymous and non synonymous sites of 347 sequences of the COI gene. All lines of evidence indicated that climatic changes and geographical and human barriers do not substantially affect the current population structure and distribution of the investigated snails."}
