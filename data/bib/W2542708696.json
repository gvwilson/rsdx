The protein concentration of the haemolymph was found\r\nto be 168 mg mLG1\r\n and the specific activity of the crude cellulase was found to be\r\n0.007 U mgG1\r\n protein using Carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC) as the substrate. The\r\npartial purification on Sephadex G-200 produced two activity peaks. The molecular\r\nweights of the two cellulase fractions were estimated to be 112,202 and 67,000. The\r\nMichealis Menten constant (km) for cellulase was 4.3 and 2.8 mg mLG1\r\n for the\r\nhigher and lower molecular weight fractions, respectively. The multiplicity of\r\ncellulase complexes indicated that the haemolymph of A. marginata may convert\r\nderived cellulose in foodstuffs such as garlic, mushrooms and domestic wastes into\r\nsources of fuel. It is suggested that the enzyme can be used to produce value-added\r\nproducts, such as ethanol, citric acid, amino acids and vitamins including primary\r\nmetabolites from cellulosic wastes."}
