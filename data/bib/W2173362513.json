Thus, we investigated whether snails are found in bird feces and checked damage to them in the oceanic Bonin Islands. Thirty individuals of five land snail species were found in 79 feces samples of Japanese White-eyes (Zosterops japonicus) and Brown-eared Bulbuls (Hypsipetes amaurotis). Two aquatic snail species were also detected in feces of Blue Rockthrushes (Monticola solitarius). Most of the shells remained unbroken, while the bodies were partly melted. When conditions were adequate, snails might be dispersed alive through bird guts."}
