Phasmarhabditis circassica sp. n. originated from Oxychilus sp. collected by the Nickel settlement in the Adygea Republic while P. clausiliiae sp. n. came from Clausiliidae gen. sp. in the Stavropol district. Phasmarhabditis circassica sp. n. is characterised morphologically by male spicules with a hollow tip, a widely conoid, spicate female tail, ensheathed dauer juveniles 896 (813-982) μ m long with a tiny but distinct cuticular apical cap and a long filamentous tail, and exsheathed dauers 773 (670-950) μ m long with a tail half as long as in the ensheathed dauers and with a rounded tip. Phasmarhabditis clausiliiae sp. n. is very close to P. circassica sp. n. in having similar morphological traits and is differentiated mainly in having a longer female tail of 94 (79-111) vs 82 (54-125 μ m) and the much smaller ratio c of 13.7 (10.3-18.4) vs 22.7 (16.8-27.5) and by its molecular characteristics. The molecular analysis based on partial sequences of LSU rDNA, and ITS rDNA regions has been performed and showed that the closest match for both new species was P. bohemica . Despite the morphological similarity between the species described, significant difference between these two new species was reported both for LSU rDNA and ITS rDNA."}
