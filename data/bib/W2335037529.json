Shell coiling in A. fulica was found to be dextral and significant variation in banding pattern within and between populations was observed. The chromosome number from well spread diakinesis and metaphase stages of meiosis in ovotestis is found to be n=30 and 2n=60, which is similar to earlier works, also the similarity in different stages is in agreement with the earlier reports."}
