We describe a series of experiments in which we could find no consistent evidence for any short-term inhibition of activity in the presence of heterospecific mucus. Furthermore snails did not consistently avoid mucus-treated surfaces or mucus-coated food. Cernuella stopped at and fed from snail faeces (both conspecific and heterospecific) more than did Theba. This suggests an alternate mechanism for interspecific competition."}
