The land-snails from a matorral grazed by sheep and cattle were studied during one year. The most frequent snail was Cernuella virgata. The lower densities were recorded in winter and the higher ones in summer. Most of the life-cycles extended on one year except for Otala lactea. The occcurence of the various species of snails depended on environmental factors."}
