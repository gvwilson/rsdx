Two species, P. ambagiosus and P. bollonsi, showed a low level of polymorphism and heterozygosity relative to other snail species. This low variation may be related to small population size, isolation, and restricted dispersal. Little differentiation was found between the three subspecies of P. bolLonsi, supporting the view that subspeciation is recent and induced by human activities. P. bollonsi on Northeast Island (Three Kings) and P. hongii on Aorangi Island (Poor Knights) were probably introduced by Maori. Extensive genetic differentiation was found between populations of the most threatened species, P. ambagiosus. Genetic distance between these populations was related to isolation by geological barriers and geographic distance. To conserve the genetic diversity within P. ambagiosus we recommend that management priority be concentrated on the six genetically distinct groups identified in this study."}
