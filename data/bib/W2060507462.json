{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/mollus/65.2.209", "year": 1999, "abstract": "A new genus of Streptaxidae with four new species is described from Central West Africa, viz. Sinistrexcisa cameruniae (type species) from Southwest Cameroon, and S. iradieri, S. cogoensis and S. fang from Equatorial Guinea. In addition to the shells, the genital anatomy of three species and the radula of one species are described. The species of Sinistrexcisa resemble some taxa of the heterogeneous genus Ptychotrema s.l., but differ conchologically by, among others, the extremely long and displaced apertural sinus and the sinistrally coiled last quarter whorl, and anatomically by the morphology of the penis, especially the inner spinulation. A spermatophore was observed in the lower (distal) portion of the penis of a specimen of S. fang. This is probably the first record of a spermatophore in the family Streptaxidae."}
