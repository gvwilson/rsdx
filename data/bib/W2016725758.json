In insects, exuviae and caterpillar frass can serve as non-destructive DNA source. Similar non-invasive sources of DNA are not yet available for endangered and rare molluscs. In this note, we report on two novel, nondestructive methods of DNA isolation in the land snail Arianta arbustorum (L.), and present nine novel microsatellite loci since previously published loci yielded a complete lack of heterozygosity."}
