A total of Ninety six (96) growing snails (Archachatina marginata). Using Plantain peel as an additive, four diets were formulated at the levels of 0%, 3%, 6%, and 9% to form the treatment diets. The experiment lasted for eight (8) weeks during which the weight gain, feed intake, shell width, shell length, shell thickness and hematological parameters were obtained. The weight gain, shell width, shell length and shell thickness are not significantly different (p&lt;0.05) whereas, the feed intake differed significantly (p&lt;0.05) for all the treatment diets in the experiment. From the results, it was concluded that concentrate with 0% inclusion of Plantain peel meal was suitable for snail diets as it gave the best performance. The hematological parameters measured in the African giant land snails are White blood cell, Neutrophile and Lymphocyte differed significantly (p&lt;0.05). Plantain peel can serve as source of potassium for other animals, as the highest percentage of potassium was found in the hemolymph of snails fed with 9% inclusion of plantain peel. It is recommended that; there should be no inclusion of plantain peels in the diet of the African giant land snails in order to achieve higher weight gain and feed intake."}
