Incorporating death assemblages into species assessments can create a more accurate understanding of pre-anthropogenic communities than survey records alone. In this study, we conducted a live-dead analysis on mollusks from a new 2008-2018 dredge survey in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. We selected the predatory banded tulip snail, Cinctura hunteria, as a test case for assessment because this species is one of several designated by the Florida Fish and Wildlife as a species of concern. Using spatial count data for shells in our samples, we estimated density values for each taxonomic grade over the sampled area using IDW spatial interpolation. These maps reveal large areas of occupation across the west Florida shelf for two taxonomic grades of dead shells but loss of offshore occurrence for live records. One explanation for the lack of occurrences in offshore habitats is that, unlike dead shell records, there is no time averaging accumulation of live shells. Time averaging increases detectability of species in habitats where they are rare. However, independent fisheries data from live-only animal surveys not only mirror our live-dead results but suggest that habitat loss in our live-dead comparisons was rapid and occurred in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Thus, live-dead comparisons reveal both natural baselines as well as anthropogenic changes in distribution without being significantly distorted by time-averaging biases. Including live-dead data can greatly improve species assessments when long-term survey records are unavailable and provide a key tool in combatting biodiversity loss across marine ecosystems."}
