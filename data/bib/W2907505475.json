Five bacterial genera occurred in wild while three in reared. Total viable counts of 4.15 and 4.60 log 10 cfu/g were observed in reared and wild control samples on Day 0 respectively but decreased to 3.72 and 4.08 log 10 cfu/g for samples treated with LJF and PAS respectively on Day 3. Changes in pH of samples were marginal. Significant ( p &lt; .05) decrease in sensory attributes occurred in all samples and became unacceptable after Day 3 except LJF preserved samples that remained acceptable till Day 9. Thus, LJF as a novel preservative is recommended for shelf life extension of both reared and wild land snails. Practical applications The results of this study indicate the practical method of preserving reared and wild land snail ( Achantina fulica ) to extend its shelf life using lime juice filtrate which is readily available and storage at ambient temperature (30 ± 2 °C) due to erratic power supply. This approach is to encourage median‐capacity industries and small‐medium enterprises to have access to simple technology especially in developing countries to enhance food security and food safety."}
