This camaenid is characterized by a combination of distinct morphological features, such as a small, weakly elevated shell with widely open umbilicus and thick callus on the parietal wall, a wide epiphallic flagellum, elongated penis and short bursa copulatrix with subglobose end. The relationships of Setocallosa with the other camaenid genera in the area are investigated by means of mtDNA, but its phylogenetic position remains ambiguous. S. pathutchingsae occurs in sympatry with Arnhemtrachia ramingining, but based on morphology the two camaenids can be readily differentiated.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:1C50CF24-7FEE-446A-9724-A0A4E850B5AA"}
