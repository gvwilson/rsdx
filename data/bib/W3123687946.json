The present study reports data on communal oviposition of a threatened tree snail, Polymita muscarum, in a Cuban agroecosystem from Yaguajay, Banes municipality, Holgu√≠n province, in a fixed plot of 119 m2. Between 2011 and 2012, we took data on oviposition site microhabitats, the number of snails/nest and the number of ovipositions/day. We found communal oviposition involving between two and 20 individuals. Usually the oviposition took place underground, at the base of trees and shrubs, between the roots. This study indicates the potential value of understanding behavioral ecology in order to better support conservation programs."}
