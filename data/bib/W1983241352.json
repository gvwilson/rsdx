A reduced supply of specific lipid compounds has been shown to be critical for growth, reproduction and survival of aquatic molluscs and might also be critical for terrestrial gastropods. The effects were investigated of different fatty acid and cholesterol supplies on the growth, reproduction, and survival of the land snail Arianta arbustorum. Surprisingly, differences in diet did not affect shell growth, time to reach adulthood, and reproductive traits such as the number of eggs, dry mass and volume of spermatophores. However, snails reared on low cholesterol diets and low polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) diets decreased their consumption rates and had a higher mortality. Snails fed a PUFA-rich diet showed higher mating activity than snails fed a diet deficient in PUFAs. A depletion of internal PUFA reserves may affect the regulation of mating behaviour because PUFAs play an important role as precursors for signal-transduction involved in the regulation of mating and reproduction. In contrast, when the diets were deficient in cholesterol, mating activity was not affected."}
