Therefore, activity of antioxidant defence system (antioxidant enzymes and reduced glutathione) and degree of oxidative damage (concentration of malondialdehyde as an index of lipid peroxidation) in the snail Helix pomatia L., 1758 were tested to check whether torpid snails are able to activate their antioxidative defence against oxidative damage prior to arousal from winter torpor. Snails, which were collected from their natural habitats, were tested at the beginning, in the middle part, and at the end of winter torpor. Active snails collected in autumn and spring were taken as control groups. Snails were immediately killed and their foot, hepatopancreas, and kidney were used for the biochemical assays. Winter torpor induced significant changes in activities of the crucial antioxidant substances. The lowest activities were observed at the beginning of torpor, whereas activity of some of these enzymes was significantly enhanced prior to spring arousal. Reduced glutathione concentration did not show time-dependent changes during winter torpor. MDA (1,3-propanedial) level was elevated in the kidney and foot but was unchanged in the hepatopancreas. In conclusion, the snail H. pomatia is able to maintain REDOX balance necessary to prevent oxidative injury during arousal."}
