Discus cronkhitei (Newcomb), Vallonia gracilicosta Reinhardt, Vallonia pulchella (Müller), Vertigo gouldii (Binney), and Zonitoides arboreus (Say) were reared on various types of organic leaf-litter substrates that simulated their natural environments. Triodopsis multilineata was the gastropod most easily reared and maintained."}
