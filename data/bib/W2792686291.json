A total of sixty (60) juvenile snails with average weight of 97.85±2.06g were randomly allotted to five treatment groups (T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5), replicated three times with four snails per replicate in a completely randomized design. The treatment was Agricultural limestone (T1), Bone Meal (T2), Egg shell (T3), Snail shell (T4) and control: natural feed (T5). The feeding trials lasted for 16 weeks. The results showed no significant differences (P>0.05) in weight gain (12.50a ± 3.15), shell length (0.35a ± 0.06) and shell width increment (0.163 ± 0.03) of the snails under the various diet. Increases in body weight, shell length, shell width was recorded in all the treatments with the highest recorded in snails (Archachatina marginata) under feed formulated with the snail shells. The result showed significant differences (P"}
