They are consumed in households or traded at local and international markets. However, African land snails are rarely farmed but picked from environments that include decaying vegetation, soil debris, and untreated human and household wastes. These ‘snail natural habitats’ may contain microbial pathogens that could easily be ingested by snails and transmitted to snail meat handlers and consumers. The objective of this study was to investigate published information that establishes the local consumption practices of African land snails as a credible source of foodborne infections. Acknowledging the nutritional benefits of consuming snails, this research revealed local practices in snail gathering, handling, preparation and preservation could significantly contribute to foodrelated disease burdens to Africans and several African snail meat-exporting countries. With this, national and international food safety regulations are required for African snail meat consumption."}
