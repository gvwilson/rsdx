MONICA TAYLOR states in NATURE of November 25, p. 701, that further inquiry is desirable in respect to the intermediate hosts of the fluke, as in some districts where water snails are rare or altogether absent, yet in these districts sheep are subject to liver-rot disease. May I add another point? In the Swansea valley, county of Glamorgan, farmers state very definitely, as the result of years of experience, that liming the land increases the liver fluke, for sheep can be run on the rough pastures in the area with slight loss from liver-rot disease, before it is limed; but after it has been so treated the loss from liver-rot disease becomes heavy, sometimes serious. Theories regarding this are many and varied, but the fact remains that the loss from liver-rot in any given area of land is definitely increased after liming. Does liming a wet sour pasture make it more congenial to the water snail?"}
