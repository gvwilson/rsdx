Thirty-three native land snails were documented. Discus patulus, Inflectarius inflectus, and Stenotrema stenotrema were the most frequently encountered and among the most widely distributed species within the area. Species richness and abundance increased around calcareous soils and outcrops of limestone but declined on the upland sites where soils are more acid and well drained. Terrestrial snail fauna at Land Between the Lakes is more diverse than once believed and represents an important Mollusca region."}
