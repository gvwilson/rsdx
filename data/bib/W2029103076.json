Breeders have to carefully handle this delicate and costly phase. The impact of population density increased with the number of animals and the duration of nursery. The highest tested densities did not have a negative effect on growth up to two weeks, after which a strong negative influence was observed. Food, here given ad libitum, was not the main limiting factor and chemical interactions between snails via mucus tracks are envisaged"}
