LDH from 8 major tissues of Helix aspersa was found to be a d -lactate specific tetramer of mol. wt 140,000 with subunits of 34,000 daltons. 2. 2. Irradiation studies indicated that individual subunits are capable of independent function. 3. 3. Electrophoresis revealed that all tissues contain the same compliment of LDH, consisting of two bands of activity. 4. 4. Michaelis constants of the foot enzyme are 0.42, 3.2, 0.02 and 0.015 mM for pyruvate, lactate, NAD+, and NADH respectively. All other tissues exhibited virtually identical K m 's . Pyruvate inhibits the enzyme from all tissues with a K i of 10 mM while lactate up to 100 mM does not inhibit. These kinetic characteristics closely resemble those of heart type LDH from vertebrate tissues. 5. 5. The presence of a pyruvate-inhibited LDH in the tissues of H. aspersa might explain why glycolytic pyruvate, as well as exogenous lactate, is channeled into fatty acid synthesis during anoxia in pulmonate land snails."}
