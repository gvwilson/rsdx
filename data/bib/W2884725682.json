These species, very similar in shell size and shape, feature different reproductive modes. The former is viviparous, giving birth to one or two neonates on a single occasion, with the number of developing embryos retained in the reproductive tract ranging from 1 to 11. The embryonic shells are 1.8–4.7 mm in height. The latter species is oviparous and produces eggs in clutches (four to six per clutch). Hatching occurs 18–21 days after egg-laying. Both species exhibit a similar growth pattern: the ultimate shell size is attained after 6.5–8.5 months and reproduction starts 5–7 months later. The distribution of viviparous reproduction among the Phaedusinae and its taxonomic importance are discussed."}
