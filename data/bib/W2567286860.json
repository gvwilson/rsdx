Three are tentatively placed in Autocoptis ( A. eburata sp. n., A. argiphrix sp. n. and A. stibe sp. n.). The fourth ( Allocoptis nebrias ), represents a new genus and species. A. stibe is from the Sierra de Neiba and the other three are from the Sierra de Baoruco. Descriptions of the shells, reproductive systems and radulae are given for the four species."}
