This investigation examined the allele frequencies at four enzymatic markers and five microsatellite loci through the genotyping of 580 individuals. A strongly significant population genetic substructuring (mean F(ST)=0.088, P<0.001) was found at the scale of the whole polders area (3050 ha) and both categories of markers displayed a similar magnitude of spatial genetic differentiation. We did not find any obvious effects of habitat fragmentation on the distribution of genetic variability. Despite the reality of habitat patchiness and environmental instability (related to farming practices), an isolation by distance process was clearly depicted, although selective pressures cannot be ruled out for one enzymatic locus. Overall, genetic drift, along with occasional long-distance episodes of gene flow, was presumably the most likely evolutionary force that shaped the observed pattern of genetic variation."}
