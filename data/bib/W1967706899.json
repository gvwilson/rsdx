Analysis of whole soft tissues demonstrates a high variability in both Pb and Ca levels in the short term, possibly associated with shell formation. Pb, Zn and Ca concentrations are also shown to vary with age-class. No simple relationship between total Ca and total heavy metal levels was found, and it is concluded that Ca does not account for the high variability between individuals. The rate of loss of each heavy metal is shown to vary with age-class."}
