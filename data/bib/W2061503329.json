The L1 were exposed to increasing desiccation with different durations (non desiccated ; 70% dry-matter (DM), 0 h ; 70 % DM, 240 h ; 90 % DM, 240 h ; 95% DM, 48 h). The larger L3 in snails were recovered from infection using the less desiccated L3 and the infection rates were also higher. The size of L3 could be an indicator of the stress that L1 underwent before infection of the intermediate hosts."}
