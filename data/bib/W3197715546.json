In total five species of Stemmatopsis are discovered, including two described herein. Stemmatopsis arcuatolabris sp. nov. has a small distorted-ovate shell with last whorl protruded quite strongly from ventral side. It has a thickened, expanded peristome with bended palatal side having a bow-like shape.
