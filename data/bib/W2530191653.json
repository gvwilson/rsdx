The diploid chromosome number for this species was 2n = 58, including 23 metacentric chromosome pairs, five submetacentric chromosome pairs and one telocentric chromosome pair; therefore, the fundamental number was FN = 56. Observed chromosomes ranged from 2.1 to 8.5% in total length and the mean total length of the chromosomes in the diploid was 95.5 ± 1.34 μm."}
