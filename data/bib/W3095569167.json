Fifteen species have been reported from the lower Mekong River area of Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. Two species, Lacunopsis auris Y.-Y. Liu, Y.-X. Wang & W.-Z. Zhang, 1980 and L. yunnanensis Y.-Y. Liu, Y.-X. Wang & W.-Z. Zhang, 1980 occur in the Yunnan Province of China. The most recent treatments of Lacunopsis date back to the 1970s and 1980s, therefore detailed information on anatomy and DNA analysis is lacking.A new species of freshwater snail (Gastropoda, Pomatiopsidae), L. yuxiensis sp. nov., is described, based on samples collected from Fuxian Lake (Yunnan, China). The new species is characterised by a solid and dark red shell with yellow spiral ribs on the whorls, reminiscent of marine gastropods of the family Trochidae. In addition to a description of the shell morphology and radula, molecular data are presented for the first time. This compilation of faunal and taxonomic data provides relevant information for use in conservation efforts. Additional molecular data may prove helpful for both reÔ¨Åning current knowledge on the morphological variability within this species and verifying the degree of cryptic diversity of this genus."}
