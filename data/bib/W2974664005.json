Egypt Results revealed that the tested materials exhibiting noticeable molluscicidal effects under both laboratory and field conditions. Mortality percentages increased with increasing concentration values and duration of exposure  . Population reduction percentages revealed the same trend when the tested materials were applied 7 days post-treatment under field conditions . Ferrous sulphate was the most effective one followed by spicy red pepper,neem, black pepper, osharfreshleaves crude extracts and osharleaves powder extract where mortality percentage of effected snails were 100, 70, 50, 45, 45 and 10 respectively at highest concentration 7 days post-treatment. The parallel % population reduction values were 90, 70, 60, 50, 20 and 20 respectively."}
