Adult snails were analyzed and compared with three hatching and 1-day old young snails stemming from the same breeding. One day after, the 2-day old individuals were raised during 1 month. Three groups of gastropods were fed with fresh lettuce (C3 plant, δ13C=−27.49‰), three groups with corn (C4 plant, δ13C=−11.7‰), and three groups ate alternately both (C3+C4). The difference between the average δ13C values of the adult snails on the one hand and the hatched and 1-day old snails on the other hand indicates a depletion of 2.47‰. Therefore, the isotopic parents–offspring signal is not preserved. The depleted ingested albumen by the snail embryo in the egg during the building of the shell could explain this depletion. The C3 diet experiment gave the expected isotopic composition difference between the diet (lettuce) and the shells (average Δ13Cshell–lettuce=13.75‰±0.52). This result shows a clear diet effect on the isotopic composition of the snail shells. For the C4 experiment, the difference in carbon isotope composition between the corn and the shell (Δ13Cshell–corn) yielded an average value of 4.89‰±0.87. The main result is that Δ13C is not constant and appears to depend on the type of ingested food. Several hypotheses can arise from this study to explain the different fractionations: (a) differences in the quality of the two diets, (b) differences in turnover rate for C3 and C4 feeders. The groups regularly fed with mixed diet yielded δ13C values showing a preferential use of C3 food for most values. The C3–C4 mixed dietary alternation probably led snails to use mainly the lettuce instead of the corn powder."}
