Snail broodstocks were fed with 5 calcium levels; triplicates for each as follow 1% (Ca1); 3% (Ca3); 5% (Ca5); 7% (Ca7) and 9% (Ca9). Snail broodstock with shell height of 35.5 – 42.4 mm were reared in the tarpaulin tanks (1 × 1 × 1 m) with the density of 60 snails/tank and the ratio of male: female was 1: 1. After 90 days of culture, mean GSI of snails in Ca5 (6.3% in male; 13.0% in female) was higher than that of Ca7 (5.7%; 10.2%) and significantly different (p"}
