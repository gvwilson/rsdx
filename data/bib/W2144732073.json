Snails from different sites differed in their mating proclivity, which resulted in non-random mating in laboratory mate-choice tests. Those snails with the higher mating propensity therefore tended to mate with their own type and tended to be chosen as partner because they were also actively seeking mates. Keeping snails under crowded conditions did not effect a lasting influence on mating behaviour in laboratory tests, despite the decline in copulatory behaviour under crowded field conditions."}
