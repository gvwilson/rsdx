Here, we describe the first records of P. gayi preying on a black snail Macrocyclis peruvianus in the wild. Two events were recorded, the first in a healthy forest in Llancahue Alto, Panguipulli, Chile, during the austral summer of 2023, and the second in a mature evergreen forest in the coastal range of La Union, Chile. These records expand our knowledge of the feeding habits and behaviour of P. gayi and add M. peruvianus to its prey list."}
