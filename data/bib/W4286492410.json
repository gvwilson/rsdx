The sampling was carried out during the spring-summer and autumn-winter periods, corresponding to the production cycles of the Helix aspersa snails (Müller, 1774), the species most frequently bred in snail farms. The samples were taken from farms located in different areas of the region. For the predatory species found in most of the farms, 38% of the individuals were of the Silpha tristis Illiger, 1798 (Coleoptera: Silphidae) species, 32% were Ocypus olens Müller, 1764 (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), and 24% were Carabus (Macrothorax) morbillosus constantinus Kraatz, 1899 (Coleoptera: Carabidae). The Lampyris sardiniae Geisthardt, 1987 (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) and Licinus punctatulus Fabricius, 1792 (Coleoptera: Carabidae) species were equally detected in 3% of the farms. In some farms, the predatory species S. tristis and C.morbillosus costantinus had caused the death of several snails. This preliminary study aimed to provide a first evaluation and description of the critical issues facing the snails present in seven Sardinian snail farms. First, a specific survey of the entomofauna during two observational periods (i.e., the spring-summer and autumn-winter periods) was conducted. Context-specific description and evaluation will allow providing valid information for Italian and European heliciculture farms to ensure the well-being of the mollusks. The presence of predatory species in snail farms is not easy to control, but some precautions could be useful to avoid massive colonization."}
