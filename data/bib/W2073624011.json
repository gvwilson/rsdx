{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/11250009109355778", "year": 1991, "abstract": "Abstract In the six species of Solatopupa, genetic information apparently disagrees with the taxonomic relationships already inferred from classical comparative analysis of shell morphology; a global re‚Äêexamination of data in a phylogenetic perspective is therefore required. Different criteria of phylogenetic inference were applied to allozyme data from previous studies (28 loci) and to a matrix of 17 binary factors descriptive of morphological characters (shell and genital anatomy) with the purpose of making a comparative evaluation of the resulting branching patterns. Results show that, in spite of the initial suggestion, there is no inconsistency between genetically and morphologically inferred phylogenies, if the morphological data are thoroughly examined and globally considerd. These data, in fact, are more insidious to interpret and often misleading. In the case under study, the apparent similarity in the shell shape is probably ascribable to homoplasy, and likely to be the result of very different evolutionary processes all leading to a juvenilized (pedomorphic) shell morphology.
