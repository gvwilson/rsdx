Embryos at various stages of development were present in the eggs during the first hour after they were laid, from 4-cell blastulae to morulae and fairly advanced stages. The advanced embryo which was fully developed on the second day bears a long cephalic sac, first to be developed, attached to the embryo and a podocyst which is attached to the foot of the embryo. Both of these structures are reduced in size as embryogenesis progresses until they finally disappear at about the 7th day after the egg was deposited. The embryonic shell was apparent on the second day and spiral coiling was apparent at about day 5. The spiral shell had one whorl when formed and more spirals were added so that at hatching the young snails had three whorls."}
