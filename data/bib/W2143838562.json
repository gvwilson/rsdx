{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/0300-9629(95)02069-1", "year": 1996, "abstract": "We investigated the effects of prolonged starvation on body weight and shell thickness, on the numbers of different types of cells, and on the Mg/Ca ratio in the digestive gland and shell in the common garden snail Helix aspersa MÃ¼ller. A 60% reduction in body weight, which occurred after periods of starvation longer than 3 months, was critical for life. Starvation had a marked effect on the relative numbers of cells in the digestive gland, and significantly decreased the number of digestive cells. The changes in Mg/Ca ratio in the digestive gland and shell were closely correlated. Changes in ion balance may have resulted from the need to compensate for the starvation-induced decline in extracellular pH. The shell acred as a reservoir of ions that could be mobilized under extreme conditions."}
