This new species has a shell that is identical to the type species of the genus, Parglogenia pelodes , which also occurs in the Top End. However, both species clearly differ in their reproductive anatomy and are also well-differentiated in terms of mitochondrial phylogenetics. A single specimen of a Parglogenia species from Croker Island, West Arnhem Land, is hypothesized to represent a third species based on details of its reproductive anatomy. However, only a single historical specimen was available for study. We therefore refrain from formally naming this species because of the incomplete information at hand. Helix subgranosa Le Guillou, 1842, a nominal species previously placed in Parglogenia , is synonymized with Xanthomelon durvillii (Hombron &amp; Jacquinot, 1841)."}
