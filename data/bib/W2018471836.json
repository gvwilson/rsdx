This snail is favoured as food, and the harvests for consumption from the wild population increase alarmingly. Thus, local authorities decided to promote research into the rearing methods for P. fibratus. Sixty‐three snails from the Isle of Pines, divided into five groups, were subjected to different temperatures (20, 25, and 30°C) and humidities (80 ± 5% and 95 ± 5%) and constant light conditions (12 h:12 h photoperiod). The variables measured were activity levels (percent active animals, i.e. outside the shell) and daily food intake rate (DFIR, in milligrams dry matter per gram of live snail weight). The average proportion of active animals throughout the experiment amounted to 14.3%, with an average DFIR of 1.61 mg/g. P. fibratus were more active (and consumed more) at lower temperatures and higher humidity levels. From 20 to 30°C the activity level dropped from 24.9 to 6.5% and DFIR from 2.7 to 0.33 mg/g (adjusted averages). Overall, P. fibratus seemed capable of tolerating average temperatures (in the region of 25°C) if humidity was high. However, around 30°C they became almost completely inactive, regardless of humidity. The light/dark regime had a very limited impact on the variables under examination, and P. fibratus’ nocturnal behaviour in the wild is likely to be explained by the need for favourable temperature and humidity levels."}
