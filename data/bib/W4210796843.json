This work records for the first time land snails living inside the pitchers of Nepenthes graciliflora, a pitcher plant endemic to the Philippines widely sold in Brazil. These gastropods were found adhered in the slippery zone of pitcher and were identified as Gastrocopta pellucida hordeacella, extending ca. 500 Km the southern limit of this species in Brazil. The possible mechanisms that allow this interaction and their implications are discussed."}
