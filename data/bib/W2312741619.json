{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.2307/2424685", "year": 1977, "abstract": "Land and freshwater snails were collected between January 1969 and January 1974 on a small number of islands west of Great Exuma, Bahamas. Different island habitats were characterized on the basis of altitude, substrate and vegetation. Island areas were determined. Presence of particular snail species within and among islands depends primarily upon the presence of particular habitats, but there is also a noticeable effect of area on species diversity. Results are discussed in relation to insular species equilibrium theory that attempts to explain island species diversity on the basis of immigration and extinction rates. Results are compatible with such theory if one assumes that habitat complexity usually closely relates to island area."}
