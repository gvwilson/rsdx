Furthermore, considerable variation in spermathecal morphology has been detected among populations of the same species. The morphological variation of the fertilization pouch was studied in five populations of the simultaneously hermaphroditic land snail Cornu aspersum (formerly, Helix aspersa). The populations studied differed in snail density and habitat humidity regimes, thus in sperm competition intensity. The study was conducted on wild adult snails and their progeny, which was reared in the laboratory for two successive generations. Finally, the morphology of the spermatheca was correlated to behavioral mating traits of the snails. The fertilization pouch consisted of a simple fertilization chamber and 4-19 blind tubules. The five studied populations did not differ in either mean number of spermathecal tubules, length of the fertilization chamber, length of the main tubule, or cumulative length of all tubules, while they differed in copulation frequency and mating propensity. No correlation was found between snail size and number of tubules, or length of any spermathecal structure measured. Additionally, no correlation was found between any behavioral trait and the morphological characteristics of the spermatheca. Strong correlations were found only among measurements of some of the spermathecal structures. Our results suggest that the complexity of the spermatheca is not related to sperm competition intensity and its structure is thus genetically determined."}
