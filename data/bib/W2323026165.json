{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.2307/2404635", "year": 1993, "abstract": "A field survey revealed that the land snail Arianta arbustorum had become extinct at 16 (55.2%) out of 29 localities in the surroundings of Basel (Switzerland) between 1908 and 1991. Habitat destruction by urban development was the reason for extinction of eight local snail populations. However, A. arbustorum also became extinct at eight localities, which were covered by vegetation suitable for the species and which still supported abundant populations of other helicid snail species including Cepaea nemoralis (all of them recorded in 1906-8). Localities where A. arbustorum persisted and localities where it went extinct did not differ in exposure, inclination, percentage of woody plant cover, height of ground vegetation, distance to the nearest water body and number of other helicid snail species present. In this paper we provide evidence that local climatic warming due to increased thermal radiation from built-up areas might be a cause for the local extinction of A.arbustorum"}
