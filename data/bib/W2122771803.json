In many cases, the morphologic analysis combined with the investigation of molecular variability, can support changes in taxonomy of studied groups. In this sense, the study of shell morphometry during snail development can contribute to the understanding of the structural mechanisms that creates the diversity observed.The morphological and ontogenetic pattern differences were collected among snails from four different populations, kept under the same laboratorial conditions. It was possible to distinguish characteristic shell morphometrics for snails from each population. The snails from Barra Mansa and Floriano, locations with smaller precipitation indexes presented smaller shell aperture values. The results are discussed in terms of the role of the reproductive strategy of this species as a factor determining shell shape.Differences in growth allometry indicated that the whole shell forming process is different among the populations, not only the final form of the adult's shell. Some allometry relationships indicated that, during the snails' development, the increase in shell width is not proportional to the increase of the width and height of the shell aperture. Thus, there is possibly an antagonism between the adoption of K-strategy and protection against desiccation. Since the spire indices of L. unilamellata morphotypes cannot be explained by physical functional aspects, the most likely explanation is the reproductive strategy of this species."}
