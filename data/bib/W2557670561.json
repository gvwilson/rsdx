Ten (10) snails consisting of five (5) black-skinned and five (5) white-skinned ectotypes were examined by using the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. Five (5) primers (OPAD-09, OPAE-04, OPAE-05, OPAF-07 and OPAF-09) were screened and selected to amplify DNA from the ten (10) samples of snails. A total of 31 bands were generated from the two snail types, out of which 14 bands were generated from the black-skinned ectotype, while 17 bands were from the whiteskinned ectotype. The DNA banding between the two ectotypes showed no statistical difference (P &gt; 0.05) between the black-skinned and the white-skinned ectotypes of Archachatina marginata. There were however, relative high genetic differences in numerical number of bands between the two ectotypes. This implied that the genetic similarities are relatively low. The high genetic differences between the two ectotypes of Archachatina marginata snails studied signaled high level of genetic diversity and heterogeneity among the giant African land snails (GALS).Keywords: DNA, Banding, Differentiation, Black-skinned, White-skinned"}
