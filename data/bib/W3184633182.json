{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.33800/nc.vi18.270", "year": 2021, "abstract": "The land snail species Drymaeus virgulatus (FÃ©russac, 1821) is recorded in St. Kitts in the form of 21 complete or fragmented shells collected on the island in November 2019. The complete shells were collected on the backshores of South Frigate Bay and Majors Bay, while shell fragments come from naturally exposed sections of the North Frigate Bay sand ridge, where they date to the pre-Columbian period. This evidence therefore attests to the past presence of this species on the island. The absence of this taxon from recent malacological surveys points to it having been extirpated from St. Kitts. Apertural fragments of a large bulimulidae collected in the caves of Tintamarre Island, near St. Martin, are also related to this taxon, adding a second West Indian island from which this species apparently disappeared in recent centuries."}
