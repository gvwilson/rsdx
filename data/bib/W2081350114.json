The structure of the spermatophore is described using light microscopy observations and histological methods. A hypothesis is presented describing the formation of spermatophores in the epiphallus and flagellum The process of spermatophore-formation is initiated in the most distal part of the epiphallus and the proximal part of the flagellum."}
