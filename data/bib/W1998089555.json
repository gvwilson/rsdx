Here, we investigate the land snail Arianta arbustorum (Helicidae) to discover whether eating several plant species is more advantageous than eating one plant species only. In the faeces of field-collected Arianta arbustorum, the plant species eaten were identified anatomically. Over 89% of the snails had eaten more than one food item within the period of 1-3 days, for which the faeces are representative. In the laboratory, Arianta arbustorum was presented with two different food plants in sequence and the amounts eaten were measured (sequentially mixed diet group)"}
