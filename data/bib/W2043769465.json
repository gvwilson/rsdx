The activity of all three species varies significantly with temperature and light, and there are differences in the activities of the species at each temperature. A. arbustorum is relatively more active than Cepaea at low rather than high temperatures, as is C. hortensis with respect to C. nemoralis , though to a lesser extent. There is little diurnal rhythm in activity at 0°C, but all species become more nocturnal as temperature increases; C. nemoralis is most, and A. arbustorum least nocturnal. The results obtained assist in explaining the observed geographical and local distributions of the species concerned."}
