(Trematoda: Brachylaimidae) in Kastamonu, Turkey. The land snails were collected in spring and autumn. The prevalence rates of infection by metacercariae of Brachylaima sp. were 5.74%, 1.68%, and 17.35% in X. obvia, Z. detrita, and M. samsunensis, respectively. This study reports for the first time the natural occurrence of Brachylaima sp. unencysted metacercariae in the hepatopancreas of these three land snails."}
