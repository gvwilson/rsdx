The brown garden snail Helix aspersa Müller, young or adult, takes in and absorbs water orally through its digestive system. 2. During the first month, Helix aspersa is able to absorb 70% of its total weight, in water, daily. This consumption suddenly drops at the end of the fourth week and progressively stabilizes around 150 μ1/g living animal daily when the snail reaches adult age. 3. During its growth, Helix aspersa achieves better control of its water balance. 4. Helix aspersa needs to drink and the water taken is always excessive and followed by excretion of the surplus through the faeces. 5. Inactive snails minimize their water loss. 6. Helix aspersa water balance appears to be very sensitive to physiological changes."}
