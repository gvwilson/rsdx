In the seventy species of mollusks examined, arginase activity was of most common occurrence in the pulmonate gastropods, being present in terrestrial, fresh-water and marine species. Only in this group of molllusks did levels of activity exceed those found in vertebrate liver. Arginase occurred less frequently in bivalves and was present in low levels only in some fresh-water and estuarine species. It was not detected in eleven marine species. Activity was not detected in a single amphineuran, but was present in two species of cephalopods. The occurrence of arginase in mollusks appears to be influenced more by taxonomic relationships than by either habitat or feeding habits. 2. In several species possessing arginase activity, the enzyme was not restricted to the hepatopancreas tissue. Arginase activity was present in all tissues examined from a land snail and octopus. 3. The levels of activity in the hepatopancreas of the land snail Otala were extremely variable among individuals of a given population kept under uniform laboratory conditions. The cause of this variation was not established. Prolonged starvation appeared to cause a slight increase in activity, while injury or estivation caused a decrease."}
