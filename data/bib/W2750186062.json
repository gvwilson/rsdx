This species inhabits the lowland forests with a narrow geographical distribution insofar as we know. The species is characterised by having a sinistral shell, a rounded periphery, an oblique columellar lip joining the basal lip smoothly, an open umbilicus, a coiled flagellum, an absent or weakly developed penial caecum, a hemispherical verge internally, and a pedunculus of the bursa copulatrix expanded medially. The new species is distinguishable from congeners by a combination of its sinistral and conical shell, and coiling of the flagellum and part of the epiphallus. The characteristics of male genitalia and species biodiversity of terrestrial snails in southern Taiwan are discussed.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:96F3118C-09B9-4ED4-AAB7-2DBEE978459F"}
