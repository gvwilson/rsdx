We report here three new records for R. decollata in Argentina, two from CÃ³rdoba Province and the first one from Misiones Province, which also constitutes the northernmost record for the country, extending its northeastern distribution range. Species-specific identification was achieved based on anatomical, conchological, and molecular information. DNA data showed that different haplotypes are present in Argentina, which originated from distinct source areas along the native range."}
