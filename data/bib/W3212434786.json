Thus, species with different distributions may present different thermal tolerance limits. Additionally, the intense reactivation of snail metabolic rate upon arousal from hibernation or estivation may provoke stress. Land snails, Helix lucorum, display a wide altitudinal distribution resulting in populations being exposed to different seasonal temperature variations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps), mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and proteins that are related to apoptosis (Bcl-2, ubiquitin), that have ‘cytoprotective’ roles and are also considered to be reliable indicators of stress because of their crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. These proteins were assessed in H. lucorum individuals from two different populations, one at Axios (sea level, 0 m) and the other at Kokkinopilos (Olympus, 1250 m), as well as after mutual population exchanges, in order to find out whether the different responses of these stress-related proteins depend solely on the environmental temperature. The results showed seasonally altered levels in all studied proteins in the hepatopancreas and foot of snails, both among different populations and between the same populations exposed to varying altitudes. However, individuals of the same population in their native habitat or acclimatized to a different habitat showed a relatively similar pattern of expression, supporting the induction of the specific proteins according to the life history of each species."}
