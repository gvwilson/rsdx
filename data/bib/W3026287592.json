For the aforementioned, landscape genetics will serve as a tool to define the potential evolutionarily significant units (ESU) for this species. To complete our objective, we evaluated the effect of cover vegetation and climate on the functional connectivity of the species from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to the present as well as the effect of climate on shell shape. Partial Mantel tests, distance-based redundance analysis and a Bayesian framework were used to evaluate connectivity. On the other hand, geometric morphometrics, phylogenetic principal component analysis and redundancy analysis were used for the analysis of shell shape. Our results suggest that the suitable areas have been decreasing since the LGM; also, vegetation cover rather than climate has influenced the genetic connectivity among land snail populations, although temperature had a high influence on shell shape in this species. In conclusion, vegetation cover was the main factor that determined the functional connectivity for the land snail; however, local selective pressures led to different phenotypes in shell shape that allowed us to postulate that each one of the previously defined genetic groups must be considered as a different ESU."}
