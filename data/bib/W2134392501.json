As such electrophoretically detected genetic anomalies have also been reported in hybrid zones involving mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects this appears to be a general phenomenon. These unexpected allozymes are inappropriately called ‘rare alleles’ and the term hybrizyme is introduced. The origins of hybrizymes are discussed in terms of suppressor-mutation systems, transposon-induced hybrid dysgenesis and intragenic recombination, but available evidence will not resolve this issue. Similarly, it is not clear whether the relatively high frequencies of particular hybrizymes are due to selection or genetic drift or some combination of these agents. Finally, the evolutionary significance of hybrizymes and the possible role of hybridization in introducing new genetic variation into populations are discussed."}
