{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/mollus/eyu039", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Organisms that live in or near watercourses often disperse with the flow of the water and therefore experience asymmetric gene flow. The asymmetric model of gene flow does not hold for organisms capable of dispersing either upstream or by land, such as amphibians and insects. I analysed genetic diversity in populations of the land snail Ventridens ligera over 300 km of the Potomac River drainage system to determine if the river has an effect on gene flow. Samples were analysed by collection site and then by river. A moderate level of genetic differentiation is present between collection sites on the rivers flowing into the Potomac River, suggesting that the upstream sites are genetically isolated. However allelic richness does not increase significantly with downstream flow as would be expected if asymmetric gene flow is present. These contrasting results suggest that V. ligera disperses by two means: (1) overland to local habitats upstream, downstream or away from the river and (2) downstream to more distant habitats by rafting on plants or debris."}
