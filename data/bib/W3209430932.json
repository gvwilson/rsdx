Gould, the involvement of a regulation process, aiming at limiting the range of intraspecific variations in adult shell size, in those land snail species with determinate growth, can be indirectly, but conveniently, diagnosed by highlighting a negative covariance between the whorls growth-rate and the whorls number reached at adulthood. However, up to now, such kind of regulation had only been demonstrated in very few cases among land snails and shelled Gastropods in general. Accordingly, quite more extensive checking is required, across both the taxonomic spectrum and the geometrical range of shell profiles. The present report is a very preliminary contribution addressing these issues, which have been neglected for too long. Considering a still limited number of eight species, yet largely encompassing both taxonomic range and shell profiles, it is shown that strong negative covariances between whorls growth-rate and whorls number are systematically highlighted, thereby supporting the involvement of an efficient regulation process of adult shell size and shape in each eight species. Moreover, the degree of regulation of the adult shell size has been quantified and this regulation proves being remarkably effective as a whole, while yet remaining highly species-specific, with very significant disparities among species â€“ and this, somewhat surprisingly, being quite irrespective of the type of geometrical profiles of shells, among the studied species."}
