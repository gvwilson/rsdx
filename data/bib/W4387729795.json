However, this species has intensively increased its distribution range to other areas. Today, it is widely distributed throughout Europe. In this study, we characterise the first noted population of H. lucorum in Poland by means of integrative taxonomy. The population is located in the centre of Warsaw city (Poland), where both live individuals (adults and juveniles) and empty shells of H. lucorum were collected. Phylogeographic analyses indicated that the specimens of H. lucorum from the Polish population show genetic similarities to populations from Turkey and Slovakia. It is crucial to evaluate the possible consequences of H.lucorum on the local species in newly discovered areas and to consider implementing measures for its eradication, if necessary."}
