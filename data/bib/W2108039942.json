Yam peel was included at 0% (YP1) control, 25% (YP2), 50% (YP3) and 75% (YP4) as replacement for maize fraction of diet of juvenile snails. Each dietary treatment was replicated thrice with 8 snails per replicate in a completely randomized design. Parameters measured were feed intake, weight gain, shell length and width. Feed conversion ratio was calculated. Significant difference was observed in the mean total weight gain (P &lt; 0.05). The highest mean weekly weight gain of 10.25 g was recorded in YP1&nbsp;which was not significant (P &gt; 0.05) different from YP3. The lowest mean weekly weight gain of 7.26 g was recorded in snail fed highest level of YP in the diet (YP4). The result of feed efficiency shows that snails fed 0.0%YP had the best feed efficiency (P &lt; 0.05) which was almost similar to YP3. The highest dressing percentage of 43.56% was recorded in YP1&nbsp;(P &lt; 0.05) which was not significantly different from 42.56 and 41.99% in YP2&nbsp;and YP3&nbsp;respectively. The highest cost per weight gain of N226.75 was recorded in YP4&nbsp;while the lowest cost per weight gain of N196.56 was recorded in snail fed diet containing 50% YP as replacement for maize fraction of the diet. It could be concluded that weight gain, feed efficiency and dressing percentage were relatively similar in the snails fed control diet and 50% YP as replacement for maize fraction of the diet and that the lowest cost per weight gain was recorded in YP3&nbsp;containing 50% YP.&nbsp; Hence maize fraction of the diet of snails could be replaced up to 50% with yam peel for feed cost reduction. &nbsp; Key words:&nbsp;Cost/weight gain, dressing percentage, feed intake, weight gain, snails, yam peel."}
