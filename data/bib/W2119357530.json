Terrestrial gastropods were collected at 55 sites among the reclaimed and unreclaimed areas from 2008–2013. The sites were grouped into 10 zones representing three major habitat types: woodland, grassland, and mixed. Of the 27 identified taxa, more were collected from woodland sites (26) than from grassland (13) or mixed vegetation sites (17). Glyphyalinia indentata and Gastrocopta armifera were the most commonly collected taxa and were found in all three major habitats. Pupoides albilabris, Zonitoides arboreus, and members of the Succineidae were found in at least 6 of the 10 zones. Woodlands now encroach on the original grassland reclamation, effecting the overall composition of the land snail community."}
