Morphological parameters of living organisms are determined by the genetic constitution of the animal, as well as formed under the influence of the environment, where climatic factors play an important role. Thus, the shell features of land-based mollusks are reliable indicators of the environmental conditions in which animals develop. Malacology has accumulated a large amount of factual material from various species of gastropods, which confirms this position. The article deals with the polymorphism on the striped shell of Helixalbescens terrestrial mollusks in the northwest og the Azov region. In the course of the research, the frequency of each morph in the sample was estimated as well as the average number of morphs (μ), the frequency of rare morphs (h), and the similarity of the samples according to the phenotype (r) was calculated. All 11 morphs were found in all populations of H. albescens from urban habitats. Three main morphs (12345, 1(23)45, 12045) were present in all studied samplings. The occurrence of rare morphs was different in urbanized and unbuilt biotopes. For example, morph 123 (45) was found only in urban biotopes, morph 12 (345) – only in the city and at point 9. The dominant morphs are 12345, 1(23)45, to which 22.6% and 32.9% of 1058 specimens or hollow shells respectively belonged. The indicator of intra-population diversity μ varied within rather narrow limits both in urbanized (from 4,899 to 7,581) and in unburied biotopes (from 4,152 to 6,697). In total, among 1058 shells and 10 samplings, 11 morphs were registered. The coloring of the shells of H. albescens differs in a considerable variety both in natural and in urbanized biotopes."}
