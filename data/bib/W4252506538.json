At the beginning of July 2020, we first met the Spanish slug (Arion vulgaris) in the Medeu State Regional Natural Park. Slimy snails predominate in the moist areas of the lower slopes of the mountains. They crowd out and replace other native animals. These species are a natural threat to local snails. Therefore, experiments were carried out on an area of 10 m2 to test biological agents against the Spanish snail (Arion vulgaris). According to the results of industrial tests, the biological preparation Bitoxibacillin (Bacillus thuringiensis var.) Showed a biological effect of 7 days — 74.9 and 7 days — 87.4 compared to the untreated control area. The biological product Aktarofit showed high biological effectiveness, providing 100% removal of Spanish mucus on the 1st day after treatment. Today, due to the annual increase in trade with foreign countries, the country has the possibility of spreading various types of pests. Therefore, to prevent these problems, further monitoring is needed to improve control of Spanish snails."}
