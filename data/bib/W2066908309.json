More than 50 different giant cells have been tested with the perfusion methods and the iontophoretic application of acetylcholine, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, bufotenine and bufotenidine in three suboesophageal ganglia of the land snail Heobania vermiculata(Helicidae). 2. Bufotenine and bufotenidine, as well as acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine, were able to affect the firing pattern of most of the neurones tested. 3. The action of bufotenidine was similar, although less potential than that of acetylcholine."}
