Juveniles are often more susceptible to predation than adults owing to their small body size and limited locomotive ability. Ezohelix gainesi (Camaenidae) is a ground-dwelling land snail that swings its shell as a strategy to avoid predation by beetles. This strategy, however, does not seem to work in juveniles, probably because of their small shell size. Instead, small individuals climb plants as an alternative strategy that is likely to avoid predation; to examine this, we initially made an experimental comparison of the rates of predation by beetles on land snails of different sizes. In these conditions, smaller snails were preyed upon more frequently than larger ones. Next, we compared the size distribution of snails on plants with those on the forest floor. Small snails occurred more frequently on plants than on the ground, and the shell diameter of land snails at 50% probability of occurring on plants was similar to that at 50% probability of predation. Climbing behaviour by small snails was also confirmed in the laboratory in the absence of predators. Therefore, plant-climbing by juvenile E. gainesi is probably an adaptive strategy to avoid predation by ground-dwelling beetles."}
