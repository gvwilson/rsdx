{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1139/z93-339", "year": 1993, "abstract": "The simultaneously hermaphroditic land snail Arianta arbustorum mates several times in the course of a reproductive season. Repeated matings might be adaptive for the male function of A. arbustorum to inseminate several \"females.\" We designed an experiment to evaluate the effects of repeated mating on the female reproductive success of this hermaphrodite. Reproductive traits and survival were examined over 2 years in individuals that copulated several times per year (snails were kept in pairs), in individuals that copulated twice (once at the beginning of each year) or once (at the beginning of the first year only), and in individuals prevented from copulating (they were kept isolated). Copulations were not always reciprocally successful: 3 of 57 snails (5.3%) failed to produce fertile eggs, although their mates reproduced successfully. Similarly, 2 of 15 pairs (13.3%) failed to reproduce successfully. Snails allowed to mate repeatedly within each season tended to lay more eggs than snails that mated once per year. However, the numbers of hatchlings did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups, because eggs laid by snails allowed to mate repeatedly had a lower hatching success. Snails that remated in the second year laid more eggs that had higher hatching success, and thus produced more hatchlings than snails that mated once at the beginning of the first year only. Snails that were prevented from mating produced a few hatchlings (by self-fertilization) in the second year; their reproductive success was less than 1% of that of mated snails. Our results suggest that multiple mating is also adaptive for the female function of A. arbustorum by increasing female fecundity and fertility and serving as a hedge against unsuccessful copulations."}
