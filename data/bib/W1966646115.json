Chlorfluazuron was found to be more toxic to the snails than flufenoxuron. The experimental snails were fed on lettuce discs treated with low concentration (1%) of each compound for a duration time of 1,2,3 and 5 days. There were no significant differences between treated and untreated snails in total proteins, total lipids and glycogen content except in the case of chlorfluazuron treated snails, the glycogen content was increased. Both compounds reduced the activity of alkaline phosphatase (AIP). Chlorfluazuron decreased the activity of acid phosphatase(AcP) and phenoloxidase (PO) enzymes, while flufenoxuron has an opposite effect. Chlorfluazuron exhibited an increase in the activities of transaminases(GOT and GPT) whereas both enzymes were not affected by the flufenoxuron treatment. These results indicated that the biochemical alteration in snail tissue caused by chlorfluazuron reflected high toxicity against the snails than flufenoxuron."}
