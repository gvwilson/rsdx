The aim of this review is to investigate the effects of heavy metal soil contamination, using the land snail Helix aspersa as a bioindicator. H. aspersa, a common species of land snail present in the area, has been used as a bioindicator of metal contamination and represents a promising ecological indicator. Various land snails species have become popular in microcosm studies because they accumulate high concentrations of certain trace metals. They express contamination as a whole through ingestion of polluted foods, such as live plants, microorganisms, soil, and water and also through cutaneous contact and from the polluted air they breathe. Land snails are considered appropriate sentinel species because trace metals tend to accumulate in their digestive gland to allow biomonitoring of metal pollution. Different experiments demonstrate that exposure in areas chronically polluted with metals, especially with lead, often causes changes in reproduction, with a variation in the mineral composition in the snail's eggs and also in its development, due to increased energy expenses associated with detoxiÔ¨Åcation and the excretion process."}
