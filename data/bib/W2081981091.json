Humidity modified oxygen consumption of dormant snails of both species. 3. Oxygen consumption during activity and dormancy was consistently lower among desert snails. 4. Thermal acclimation of active snails did not alter respiration: temperature relations in either species. 5. Light-to-dark changes in illumination elevated metabolic rates in active desert snails."}
