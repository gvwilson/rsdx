{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1071/wr9910147", "year": 1991, "abstract": "The diet of sleepy lizards, Trachydosaurus rugosus, from a population near Tickera, South Australia, was determined by direct observations, stomach content analysis and food choice trials. They were found to be opportunistic feeders with a diverse diet of mainly flowers and berries, selected from 27 of the 85 plant species identified on two study plots. They were also found to feed on invertebrates, mainly the introduced land snail, Thebapisana. Availability of different food types changed with season, and the lizard diet adjusted to the changes. The spring home ranges of lizards contained a higher proportion than random, of sampling squares in which common spring food plants were recorded. However, the abundance of food plants makes it unlikely that food resources influence home range size."}
