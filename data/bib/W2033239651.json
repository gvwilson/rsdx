Moreover responses of glycolytic enzymes from cold acclimated R. ridibunda and H. lucorum were studied as well. The drop in Po2 in the blood of hibernated frogs and land snails indicated lower oxygen consumption and a decrease in their metabolic rate. The activities of glycolytic enzymes indicated that hibernation had a differential effect on the glycolyis in the two species studied and also in the tissues of the same species. The activity of l-LDH decreased significantly in the skeletal muscle and heart of hibernated R. ridibunda indicating a low glycolytic potential. Similar biochemical responses were observed in the same tissues during cold acclimation. The continuous increase in the activities of glycolytic enzymes studied, except for HK, might indicate a compensation for the impacts of low temperature on the enzymatic activities. In contrast to R. ridibunda, the activities of the enzymes increased and remained at higher levels than those of the prehibernation controls indicating maintenance of glycolytic potential in the tissues of hibernating land snails."}
