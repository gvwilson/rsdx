The species taxonomy of the group is based merely on the basis of shell morphology, but validity of the existing taxonomy is uncertain. Using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data (cytochrome oxidase I and 16S rRNA sequences) we were able to validate the observed phylogenetic taxa within the I. gualtieranus s.l. complex by means of the analysis of specimens of the different morphospecies, together with the study of topotypes. Strong incongruences were obtained between morphology and molecular data. The Iberus alonensis morphospecies comprised several genetically divergent but morphologically cryptic lineages. Considering (1) the allopatric distribution of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs), (2) the morphological differentiation, (3) the possible occurrence of hybridization among the different lineages, and (4) the strong differentiation of the mtDNA phylogroups, we suggest the main lineages obtained, for the time being, may be treated as evolutionary species. The robust phylogenetic reconstruction obtained allows us to consider I. alonensis s.s., Iberus campesinus, Iberus carthaginiensis, and Iberus gualtieranuss.s. as valid species. Two additional unnominated taxa of the alonensis shell type have also been identified. Further subdivisions are also considered, including Iberus gualtieranus mariae and Iberus gualtieranus ornatissimus."}
