{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(90)91038-i", "year": 1990, "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that magnetic fields can affect a variety of opioid-mediated behavioral and physiological functions. The p present experiments were designed to examine the effects of various durations of day- and night-time exposures to low intensity (1.0 gauss rms) 60 Hz magnetic fields on light (L) and dark (D) period opioid-mediated aversive thermal (‘nociceptive’) responses and morphine-induced ‘analgesia’ in the nocturnally-crepuscularly active land snail, Cepaea nemoralis. The snails displayed a LD rhythm in the latency of their aversive (40 °C) thermal (nociceptive) responses, showing a significantly greater response latency at night than during the day. Administration of morphine (10 mg/kg/2.0 μl) elicited significant increases in the thermal response latencies indicative of the induction of analgesia. The snails displayed a significantly greater analgesic response at night than during the day. Exposure (0.50, 2, 12, 48 or 120 h in L or D) to the 60 Hz fields reduced morphine-induced analgesia in both the L and D periods, with the magnetic stimuli having significantly greater inhibitory effects in the D period. The magnetic fields also significantly attenuated the level of the dark period basal nociceptive response latencies, while not affecting the light period responses. In both the L and D periods the degree of attenuation of the analgesic and nociceptive response latencies was related to the duration of exposure to the 60 Hz magnetic fields. These findings show that exposure to weak 60 Hz magnetic fields significantly affects the LD rhythms of opioid-mediated behavioral thermal responses in the land snail Cepaea with the magnetic stimuli having a markedly greater effect in the D period. These results also indicate that the effects of 60 Hz magnetic fields are dependent on the duration and temporal patterning of exposures."}
