It is now present in at least 52 countries worldwide, with an actively expanding range. Lissachatina fulica was first introduced to India in 1847, but subsequent arrivals in India and local patterns of spread remain unclear. This study uses the 16S rRNA gene to identify the extent of genetic variation in India by sampling Indian populations and comparing them with published sequence data. A total of 307 snails were collected from 178 localities in India and from a single locality in the UAE, and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. Eight haplotypes were identified from India of which four are newly recognized. The new haplotypes identified in this study have increased the number of L. fulica 16S rRNA haplotypes from 19 to 23. Examination of haplotype and nucleotide diversities revealed that genetic variation is low in India, the UAE and across Asia as a whole. The number of haplotypes was higher in India when compared to other invasive regions but all of the Asian haplotypes appear to be closely related to the most common haplotypes in the Indian Ocean Islands. Heavy trade between the snail-infested and native-range countries suggests that the variation observed in India might be traced back to its native range, but the lack of sampling and paucity of sequences from East Africa currently prevents a comparison. Tracing back the emergent haplotypes by additional sampling could throw more light on the spread of L. fulica."}
