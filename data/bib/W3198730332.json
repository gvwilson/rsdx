The tested insecticides were selected from three different chemical groups, carbamates, pwithroides and omanophosphates successively. The obtained results revealed that, the three insecticides revealed obvious molluscicidat activity against the tested snails, recording 96-h/LCSO. Neomyl was the most effective one, there was no survivals at highest concentrations after 24-hours post-treatment. According to LCSO, LC90, Mikity index and Relative potency at the two levels, the descending order of the tested insecticides was, neomyf, solfac and sumithion. M. cattusiana snails were more affected by the tested insecticides than Enamiallata under field conditions. According to the obtained results , it can be recommended by using these insecticides as molluscicides among the integrated pest management (IPM ) programs."}
