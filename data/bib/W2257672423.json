Most live snails and empty shells were adults (83% and 85% respectively) and the low proportion of empty adult shells (36%) compared with live adult snails found in an area last burnt in the late 1950s suggests that the population there is still recovering. Growth was measured using snails recaptured with the aid of harmonic radar transponders attached to their shells. Increase in shell length varied from 6 to 25 mm per year in juveniles with shells &gt;38 mm long, but it slowed when juveniles approached maturity (adult shell length 55-89 mm). The juvenile period is greater than three years and growth in shell length virtually stops when a thick aperture lip develops. This lip continues to thicken at 0.1-0.4 mm per year and can reach a maximum thickness of 15.5 mm, indicating that adults may live 10 years and possibly more than 30 years. A comparison of our data with two previous studies on the same population and on Aorangi Island, in the Poor Knights Islands group, confirms that these snails are slow developing, have low recruitment of adults, and that populations are probably maintained by a pool of long-lived adults. Our results indicate that following predator control on the mainland, the recovery of a snail population is likely to be slow. Once a population has recovered it could be maintained by intensively controlling rodents for periods of greater than three years (to allow recruitment of adults into the population) alternating with longer periods without control."}
