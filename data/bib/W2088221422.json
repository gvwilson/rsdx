The complete mitochondrial genome of M. kiangsinensis was first determined using long PCR reactions and primer walking method (accession number KM083123). The genome has a length of 14,029 bp, containing 37 typical mitochondrial genes (13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes and 2 rRNA genes). The base composition of the whole heavy strand is A 29.48%, T 37.92%, C 14.38% and G 18.22%. Gene order of M. kiangsinensis is identical to Euhadra herklotsi, but gene rearrangements are found compared with other mitochondrial genomes described in Stylommatophora. tRNAThr is located in COIII, which has not been found in other helicoids so far. This new complete mitochondrial genome can be the basic data for further studies on mitogenome comparison, molecular taxonomy and phylogenetic analysis in land snails and Molluscs at large."}
