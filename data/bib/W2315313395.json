Twenty‐six representatives of 17 nominal species and a suspected hybrid were examined by sequence analysis of a PCR‐amplified mitochondrial DNA fragment of the large rRNA subunit gene. Maximum parsimony and neighbor‐joining phylogenetic analyses demonstrate a complex pattern of speciation and differentiation and suggest that Albinaria species from Crete belong to at least three distinct monophyletic groups, which, however, are not monophyletic with reference to the genus as a whole. There is considerable variation of genetic distance within and among “species” and groups. The revealed phylogenetic relations do not correlate well with current taxonomy, but exhibit biogeographical coherence. Certain small‐ and large‐scale vicariance events can be traced, although dispersal and parapatric speciation may also be present. Our analysis suggests that there was an early and rapid differentiation of Albinaria groups across the whole of the range followed by local speciation events within confined geographical areas."}
