The mango seed kernel meal used as test ingredient were collected, cracked and the kernel sundried for two weeks after which it was milled into a fine powder. Four dietary treatments were formulated to meet the nutrient requirements of snails. The mango seed kernel meal was included at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%, representing Diet 1, Diet 2, Diet 3 and Diet 4 respectively. Diet 1 served as the control. Snails of similar weights were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments and replicated three (3) times in a completely randomized design (CRD) experiment. Each dietary treatment consisted of thirty (30) snails per treatment with ten (10) snails per replicate. The snails were fed ad libitum. At the end of the 56 days feeding trial, four (4) snails sampled from each replicate were randomly selected for haemolymph and mineral analysis. Data collected on different parameters were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that there were significant differences (p"}
