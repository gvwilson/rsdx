We described the complete mitochondrial genome of Euphaedusa planostriata (Heude, 1882). The mitogenome is 15,041bp in length, with a total of 37 genes, including 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes. It is consistent with the basic characteristics of the known stylommatophoran mitochondrial genome. Phylogenetic analysis using mitogenomes showed that Euphaedusa planostriata is clustered with Albinaria caerulea, supporting the monophyly of this family. Our study provides valuable information that can be used toward the conservation genetics, taxonomy and evolution of clausiliid snails."}
