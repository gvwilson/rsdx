Soil organisms will need to respond to pollution stressors. Among them, land snails are valuable indicators of ecosystem disturbance. In this study, land snails Helix pomatia were sampled from three city localities with different traffic intensity. Oxidative stress biomarkers catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the foot muscle (FM) and hepatopancreas (HP) tissue were determined. Also, five heavy metal (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) concentrations were quantified in soil and tissue samples. According to the results, the highway induces the strongest contamination on the surrounding environment, with the highest metal concentrations measured in soil and snails. At the most polluted locality, only Cd exceeded some soil guidelines authorities that we referred to in this study. In addition, tissue Cd concentrations exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) value (1 mg kgâˆ’1) for soil invertebrate toxicity at all localities making it likely responsible for generating adverse effects in snails. Regarding HP, the CAT and GST are the most sensitive parameters that could be useful as oxidative stress biomarkers in snails exposed to the actual metals in the environment. On the other hand, in FM tissue, the most pronounced changes were recorded for GPX and GR. Based on tissue-specific enzyme responses, three urban populations were clearly separated. Therefore land snails are the promising candidates for quick field-based biomarker studies after showing a tissue-specific concentration-dependent induction of certain enzymes to heavy metals."}
