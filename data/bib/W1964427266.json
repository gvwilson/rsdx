Over four years, the density of adult (two-year-old) snails was estimated as ranging from 39 to 202 m−2 during the summer active season; half-grown juvenile (one-year-old) density was estimated during the same time of year as between 13 and 436 m−2; no estimates were made of the density of younger snails. Significant aggregation was shown for both adults and juveniles. Estimates of variance of dispersal over 100 days (0·489 to 1·601 m2) suggest that T. pisana is rather sedentary when compared with the few other snail species for which comparable information is available. Combining the data on density and dispersal with an estimate of variance of family size, yields estimates of effective neighbourhood size ranging from 115 to 4130. These results are compared with data for other organisms, especially other species of land snail."}
