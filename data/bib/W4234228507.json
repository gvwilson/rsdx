The historical context of the expedition and the study of its collected material are described. Biographical data is given for the main persons involved. The land snails were previously studied by Joaquin Hidalgo between 1867 and 1893. A total of 3470 specimens belonging to 211 species are treated in this paper.

A lectotype is now designated for Drymaeus ( Drymaeus ) chanchamayensis (Hidalgo, 1870); Bulimus visendus Hidalgo, 1869 is now placed in the genus Synapterpes Pilsbry, 1896, a new combination."}
