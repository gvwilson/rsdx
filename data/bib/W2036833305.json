A significant increase in the proportions of all juvenile snails with shells larger than 10 mm long was observed. The only other comparable population of this highly endangered snail species, P. a. michiei, was 33·7 km to the east. Here, predation mostly by birds had a similar effect on reducing adult snail recruitment as rodents did on P. a. paraspiritus. No predator control was done at the site occupied by P. a. michiei, and adult snail recruitment remained low throughout the study. This suggests that long-term pulse poisoning of rodents in remnant ‘islands’ of native habitat on the New Zealand mainland can be beneficial to the recovery of a landsnail population."}
