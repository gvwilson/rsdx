Satsuma (Luchuhadra) largillierti is an arboreal land snail endemic to Okinawa Island, Japan, in which extensive geographic variation in shell morphology has long caused taxonomic complication. To establish robust species limits among S. largillierti and its allies, we perform molecular and morphological analyses of snails sampled from the entire range of Luchuhadra. Analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequences divide S. largillierti into two, reproductively isolated groups. Each of these groups includes Satsuma erabuensis and Satsuma sooi, respectively, which occur on a nearby island and were traditionally regarded as distinct species. Morphometric analysis of the genitalia further provides clear difference between the two groups, whereas differentiation in shell morphology is slight if any. These results indicate that the traditional taxonomy has overly depended on inadequate morphological difference and a priori information of island geography, which resulted in oversimplification of complex speciation history in Luchuhadra."}
