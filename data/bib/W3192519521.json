The current research follows up on the monitoring that took place there at five-year intervals in the years 1984–2009. In the 1980s, 43 land snail and seven aquatic species were recorded, while in 2020 the list included 56 land snail and three aquatic species. Although the reserve is considered to be one of the best examined areas in the capital city, remarkable findings are presented, such as a viable population of the critically endangered Helicopsis striata, a new locality of the internationally protected Vertigo angustior, and a recent distant spread of the rare snail Zebrina detrita. Notable trends in the development of local malacofauna in the last four decades are discussed."}
