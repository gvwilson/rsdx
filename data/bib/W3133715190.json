The growth phases were: snailet, juvenile and Adult based on the number of whorls on the shell and weight of the snails. Highest concentration of glucose and lipids were recorded at the juvenile phase (40.20mg/dl), while least values for glucose (20.00mg/dl) and lipids (37.80mg/dl)were recorded during snailer and adult phases respectively. A progressive increase in the concentration of protein was observed as the snails moved from snailetphase to adult phase, hence snails in adult phase had highest concentration of protein in their haemolymph. Growth phases significantly (p&lt;0.05) affected the haemolymph mineral composition of the snails, juvenile phase had the highest values in ca2+,PO4+ and Na+, while the adult phase recorded the least concentration in ca2+, Na amd cl-2. Juvenile growth phase of A. marginata thus has better haemolymph biochemical values than both snailet and adult growth phases."}
