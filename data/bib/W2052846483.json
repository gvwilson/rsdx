The snails fed at night on fallen leaves from a variety of broadleaf trees and bushes. During the day, most snails in shrubland rested under plants close to their food sources at densities of up to 53 snails per m2 and mean live biomasses of 47–72 g/m2. Individual snails stayed close to their food plants for up to 12 years, seldom moving away. Resting behaviour and site fidelity in forest was not investigated in detail, but some adult snails in forest returned to their original sites after being moved up to 60 m into a fenced area built to protect them from feral domestic animals. The ovoid eggs (mean 7.0 mm long×5.6 mm wide; ranges 5.5–7.7 mm long; 5.1–6.7 mm wide) were laid in clutches averaging 43 eggs (range 1–113 eggs) in shallow cavities covered with soil. More than one snail may contribute to a clutch. Adult shell height ranged from 43 mm to 97 mm and varied with habitat quality. Where snail abundance was high adults were small. Implications of these results for conservation management are discussed."}
