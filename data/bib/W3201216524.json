Its current systematic position is based on morpho-anatomical characters combined with a molecular phylogeny based on two partial mitochondrial markers (COI and 16S rDNA) and a nuclear gene fragment (28S rDNA). Our results indicate that Khmerquantula gen. nov. is a member of the Dyakiidae with very strong support from both morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses. The diagnostic characters of this new genus and new species, Khmerquantula leipo are a dextral shell with a well-polished surface, animal with only three dorsal lobes, and reproductive organ without penial verge and amatorial organ papilla. This finding adds a new taxon to current biodiversity and illustrates the growing knowledge of the endemic malacofauna in Cambodia.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:5E5201B1-5BE6-452F-8D1A-B292DBA4AC25http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:0D0414A4-FDA5-4E59-BAFE-1E1B68F37E36http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:E08633F4-F5E1-4D99-8C70-252DF349C39A"}
