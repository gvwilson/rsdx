Intense importation of building and gardening materials has since increased the risk of introducing new snail species to the islands. This article is based on material and observations from observers around the islands over several years, who have contacted the first author. This has resulted in the discovery of seven new species to the islands in addition to Solhøy’s twenty species. Four of the new species are snails, while two are slugs. An additional species was introduced for commercial purpose but does not seem to have survived well in the Faroese climate.It is difficult to predict the consequences of the settlement of these new Faroese gastropod species, but they may act as intermediate hosts for parasites, having cats and dogs as final hosts."}
