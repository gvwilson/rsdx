Both the upper and lower lethal temperatures were body size dependent since the large size snail were more heat and cold resistant as compared with the small size snail. Thus , the upper LT-50s was increased from 39.3C to 43.7C. As a result of increasing the average weight from 0.5 to 30.7grs also, the lower LT-50s was decreased from 1.7 to -2.1C as a result of increasing average Weight from 0.7 to 3.8 gms."}
