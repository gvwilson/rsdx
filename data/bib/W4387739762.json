Here, we present the first carbon (δ 13 C) and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotope values of snail shells in interior Alaska to explore changes in vegetation and humidity through the late-glacial period. Snail shell δ 13 C values were relatively consistent through the late glacial. However, late-glacial shell δ 13 C values are 2.8‰ higher than those of modern shells. This offset is best explained by the Suess effect and changes in the δ 13 C values of snail diet. Snail shell δ 18 O values varied through the late glacial, which can be partially explained by changes in relative humidity (RH). RH during the snail growing period was modeled based on a published flux balance model. Results suggest a dry period toward the beginning of the Bølling–Allerød (~14 ka) followed by two distinct stages of the Younger Dryas, a wetter stage in the early Younger Dryas from 12.9 to 12.3 ka, and subsequent drier stage in the late Younger Dryas between 12.3 and 11.7 ka. The results show that land snail isotopes in high-latitude regions may be used as a supplementary paleoclimate proxy to help clarify complex climate histories, such as those of interior Alaska during the Younger Dryas."}
