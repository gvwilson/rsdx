Kramarenko, S. S., Dovgal, I. V. - Th e results of investigations of intrapopulation patterns in the land snail Brephulopsis cylindrica (Menke, 1828) variation are discussed in the article. Th e self-similar intrapopulational groups (demes) with sets of random (chaotic) and ranked (clinal) patterns of morphological characters were observed. It is argued that the self-similar elements lead to the formation of spatial variability patterns with distinct fractal nature. Thus the relative roles both of the random and the regular components can be detected for separate characters according to the degrees of nearness or remoteness of fractal dimension to 2.0."}
