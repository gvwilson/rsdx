{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/cbdv.200690011", "year": 2006, "abstract": "The levels of bio-accumulated trace metals in the African giant land snail Archachatina marginata, collected in six different states of Southern Nigeria, were determined. The Cu and Fe levels were 3.0–9.8 and 12.4–35.2 mg/kg body weight, respectively (Table). Similarly, the concentrations of Zn, Ni, Pb, and Cd were 10.3–20.5, 3.20–10.4, 0.80–6.00, and 0.60–0.84 mg/kg, respectively. Although the trace-metal levels for some samples collected in highly industrialized zones approached or even considerably exceeded the upper WHO limits, the average concentrations of trace metals recorded in this study remained below critical values."}
