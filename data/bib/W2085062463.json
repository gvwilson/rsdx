Development state, water content and acclimation may affect their supercooling ability. In this study, we measured fresh mass, water content and temperature of crystallisation (T(c)) of eggs of the edible land snail Cantareus aspersus, depending on its form (\"aspersa\"vs. \"maxima\"), incubation temperature (20, 12 and 7 degrees C) and physiological age (as part of the complete development). We also tested their tolerance to freezing. Despite a high number of individual observations (n=759) and significant differences of fresh mass and water content between both subspecies, no effect of origin, incubation temperature or development state has been found in this study. T(c) remained constant whatever the condition, with an overall mean of -5.40+/-0.24 degrees C (mean+/-SD). We suggest that fresh mass is important, a high water content and a constantly wet surface confer to land snail eggs a poor ability to supercool. Moreover, the presence of ice nucleating agents at the egg surface (microorganisms present in the soil, calcium carbonate crystals of the egg shell) might induce freezing. Thus, considering the present results, to delay hatching by cryopreservation of eggs does not seem possible."}
