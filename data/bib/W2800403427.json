This knowledge, however, would help planning effective conservation measures of rare and endangered species. We studied overwintering of two snail species, Vertigo moulinsiana and V. angustior, having high conservation priority according to the European Union Habitat Directive. The study was conducted in two localities in western Poland. The material was collected three times in six-week intervals, from February to April 2016. The analyses showed that the abundance of overwintering individuals of V. angustior was positively correlated with the amount of litter and mosses. In the case of V. moulinsiana, more juveniles were found in litter than on plants. Adults of this species, however, were overwintering on plants rather than in litter. Our study indicates that different protection measures are necessary to increase the survival rates of V. angustior and V. moulinsiana in winter."}
