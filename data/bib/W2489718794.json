Several living specimens were collected from an urban garden in the Wellington suburb of Brooklyn in 2015 and 2016, and constitute the first records of this species from New Zealand. Searches in surrounding suburbs have so far failed to find further snails. Eradication from Brooklyn may be viable but it seems likely that the species occurs elsewhere and the potential threat it poses to native species and agriculture, should it become established in New Zealand, appears low."}
