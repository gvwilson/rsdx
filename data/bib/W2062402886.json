Sixteen pairs of samples were collected from Nottinghamshire sites with contrasting backgrounds. In comparisons between the members of each pair, all the samples from darker habitats had a higher proportion of dark-mantled morphs, and most had a higher proportion of dark-shelled morphs. These highly significant associations between habitat and morph-frequency provide good evidence of natural selection acting on these colour polymorphisms."}
