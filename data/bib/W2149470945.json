(Asclepiadaceae), methomyl, and methiocarb was evaluated against the land snail Monacha obstructa (Ferussac) at 25 degress C. The LD50 value of the plant extract after 24 h of treatment was 60.9 mug/snail, whereas the LD50 values of the two tested carbamate pesticides after 72 h of treatment were 11.9 and 27.4 mug/snail, respectively. Only contact toxicity tests were used in this study because cardiac glycosides and plants containing them, including P. tomentosa, have a strong antifeedant effect against land snails. Further studies are needed to isolate and identify the molluscicidal compound(s). The possible uses of plants that contain cardenolides, as molluscicides, are discussed.
