This study examined the differences in shell size and shape across both sexes of Leptopoma perlucidum land snails. We collected 84 land snails of both sexes from two isolated populations on two islands off Borneo. A total of five shell size variables were measured: (1) shell height, (2) shell width, (3) shell spire height, (4) aperture height, and (5) aperture width. We performed frequentist and Bayesian t-tests to determine if there was a significant difference between the two sexes of L. perlucidum on each of the five shell measurements. Additionally, the shell shape was quantified based on nine landmark points using the geometric morphometric approach. We used generalised Procrustes and principal component analyses to test the effects of sex and location on shell shape. The results showed that female shells were larger than male shells across all five measurements (all with p-values < 0.05), but particularly in regards to shell height and shell width. Future taxonomic studies looking to resolve the Leptopoma species' status should consider the variability of shell size caused by sexual dimorphism."}
