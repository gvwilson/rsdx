Three methods of bioassay were used, i.e. contact,leaf-dipping and bait techniques. The results indicated that the ethanol crudeextract of Cumin was the most toxic extract for the two tested land snailspecies followed by Golden shower, Umbrella tree and pomegranate extracts whileOlive extract had the lowest effect. The land snail, E. vermiculata wascomparatively less susceptible to the tested plant extracts than the landsnail, M. obstructa. Results showed that, contact technique of thetested plant extracts was the most effective method of application. The LC50values of Cumin, Golden shower, Umbrella tree, Olive and Pomegranate extractswhen applied as contact were 250, 325, 635, 1500 and 910 ppm for M.obstructa and 288, 380, 682, 1720 and 965 ppm for E. vermiculata,respectively."}
