Yet, for understanding of evolutionary drivers leading to repeated changes of reproductive strategy, the identification of life history traits in phylogenetic lineages and geographical regions is fundamental. In this paper, we identified reproductive modes of clausiliid species endemic to Taiwan: Changphaedusa horikawai, Formosana formosensis, F. swinhoei, and an undescribed new species Formosana sp. Observations were conducted under laboratory conditions. Among Formosana species, oviparity predominated but embryo-retention was also recorded. The size of eggs and egg clutches differed between studied taxa. In contrast, C. horikawai was viviparous and delivered neonates. Anatomical examination of the fresh material allowed for unique observation of a large podocyst in embryos kept in the genital tract. This flattened structure may enable respiration or nutrient transfer between an embryo and a parent. In the regularly sampled wild population from Dawulun (N. Taiwan), gravid individuals were collected between April and November. The number of embryos reached three to nine per gravid individual. None of the species reproduced by self-fertilisation. Results of our study may support implementing conservation measures for malacofauna of Taiwan."}
