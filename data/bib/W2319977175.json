{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.2307/3545391", "year": 1992, "abstract": "Intraspecific interactions early in an individual's life may lead to reduced reproduction once maturity is attained. Possibly, this could be compensated by increased or prolonged reproduction later in life if competition is relaxed (i.e. after a sudden decrease in population density as the result of a catastrophic event). We tested this compensation hypothesis in the ovoviviparous, self-fertilizing land snail Balea perversa (L.). Juvenile snails were kept for 450 d at different densities on their natural substrate and food (pieces of limestone providing epi- and endolithic lichens). After this period of intraspecific competition, individuals were kept singly under conditions of high food supply for the rest of their life (126-484 d; period of relaxed competition)"}
