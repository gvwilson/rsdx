The laboratory generation\r\n\r\nsnails were divided into 2 groups, the first was exposed to a concentration of 10 mg/L of the pesticide, as the\r\nlethal concentration of the pesticide was 12.6mg/L, and the second was left as a control group. After that,\r\nthree snails from each group were dissected by the end of the following intervals (10mins, 1hr, 8hrs, 24hrs,\r\n3days, 7days, and 15day). The gene expression was studies using qPCR method. Results of the genetic\r\nanalysis for the abundance of the HSP70-HSP90 showed a clear effect of the pesticide on the treated snails\r\nduring the above interval.\r\nOn the other hand, the results of the histological study of the gills showed that the pathological changes\r\nvaried in their intensity during the intervals, while there was no clear effect to variation of concentrations.\r\nThese changes involve loss of cilia in the epithelial cells, infiltration of granulocytes in the cilia loss regions,\r\nhyperplasia, degradation and necrosis of cells as well as the accumulation of non-living brown and grey\r\nmaterials within the epithelial cells. Moreover, it was noticed that the mucous materials secreted from cystic\r\ncells has increased."}
