The molluscs were collected from a regular grid in recultivated soil (the research station of Dnipro State Agrarian and Economic University, Pokrov, Ukraine). As predictors of the snail population abundance, spatial variables were used, as well as edaphic and vegetation indices. It is shown that V. pulchella prefers microsites characterized by higher soil electrical conductivity, which contain larger aggregate fractions with low mechanical impedance and the low temperature at the depth of 0-10 cm, with a more developed dead plant layer, low-light and low hygromorph and heliomorph index values of the vegetation."}
