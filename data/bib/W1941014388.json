With a few exceptions at surface sites, the faunal remains were recovered from intact subsurface deposits in association with charcoal samples that yielded radiocarbon and/or AMS dates. Faunal data for the early El Palto phase are derived from dated contexts at JE-790 in the Q. Talambo and JE-996 and JE-1002 in the Q. del Batán of the lower Jequetepeque Valley. Faunal data for the late El Palto phase are derived from subsurface contexts at JE-439 and JE-993 in the Q. del Batán and JE-431 and JE-790 in the Q. Talambo. In addition, a few faunal remains recovered from the surface at JE-439 and JE-993 were included in the study because they were found in association with Paiján stone tools. Assemblages from various sites in the Jequetepeque and Zaña valleys yielded evidence of Las Pircas phase fauna, including JE-772, JE-937, and JE-1002 in the Q. del Batán and Q. Talambo areas and CA-09–27, CA-09–28, CA-09–52, CA-09–77, and CA-09–85 in the Nanchoc Valley. Only two sites yielded limited faunal data from a dated Tierra Blanca phase context: CA-09–71 and JE-901 in the Nanchoc Valley and in middle upper reaches of the Q. del Batán, respectively. In addition to these remains, large quantities of land snail shells, including middens, were recorded on or near the surface of numerous sites in the Q. del Batán and Q. Talambo."}
