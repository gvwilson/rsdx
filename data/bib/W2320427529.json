{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1995.tb02279.x", "year": 1995, "abstract": "In the southern Appalachian region of North America, the phylogenetically convergent shells of the polygyrid snails Triodopsinae Neohelix major (Binney) and Polygyrinae Mesodon normalis (Pilsbry) are even more convergent in size and shape in sympatry (7 sites) than in allopatry (23 and 10 sites). Environmental correlations account for 34% and 30% of size and shape variations in N. major (larger, taller, and more loosely coiled at northern, high-altitude, sheltered sites), but for only 14% and 9% in M. normalis (larger, flatter, and more loosely coiled at south-facing, exposed sites). The statistical significance of the sympatric convergence dropped out when these correlations were removed. This phenomenon helps account for the many cases in eastern North America of nearly identical land-snail shells in sympatry and questions the importance of competitive character displacement in the evolution of land-snail shell morphology. This apparently nonmimetic case of sympatric convergence provides an unusually precise and well-delimited, naturally replicated experiment in evolutionary morphology, which is analyzed for controlling factors in a follow-up paper."}
