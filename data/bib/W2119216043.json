The present study revealed significant intraspecific differences in resistance to desiccation which are correlated with habitat and climatic gradients within the distribution range of the species. Populations from more arid sites were more resistant to desiccation and heat exposure than those from more mesic areas. However, the population from the Rift Valley (an extremely arid region) was surprisingly poorly resistant. Rates of population water loss under the controlled experimental conditions in the laboratory generally matched the calculated water losses during natural summer aestivation."}
