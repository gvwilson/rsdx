Most examined plots belong to young forests; in particular, three age classes were considered (class 1, <22 years; class 3, 38â€“56 years; class 5, >77 years). Twenty-seven species and 2433 individuals were recorded. Box plots showed that forest age did not seem to be a key factor for land snail species richness and abundance at least in the time range of examined forests. However, this may not be true, if real old-growth forests are considered. No differences between evergreen and deciduous forest were found too. With regard to species composition, Non-metric multidimensional scaling demonstrated an assemblage of species widespread in all forest age classes, while Indicator Species Analysis failed to identify any species as indicator for any age category. This shows that a process is underway but has had insufficient time to differentiate assemblages and to accumulate the majority of rare species, due to the young nature of examined forests. Habitat structure may affect communities more than forest age: suitable microhabitats (a few old/very old trees for shelter) are a sufficient prerequisite for land snail diversity, ensuring community survival and protection, irrespective of forest age class. These findings highlight the importance of habitat structural complexity at local scale for preserving invertebrate diversity in Mediterranean secondary forests."}
