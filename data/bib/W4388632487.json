During this interaction, the risk of loosening particles is obvious without having a specialized mechanism holding them on the tooth surface. As mucus secretions are essential in molluscan life cycles and the locomotion and attachment gels are known to have an instant high adhesion, we have hypothesized that the saliva could support particle retention during feeding. As adhesion of snail saliva was not studied before, we present here an experimental setup to test its particle-binding capacity using a large land snail (Lissachatina fulica, Stylommatophora, Heterobranchia). This experiment was also applied to the gels produced by the snail foot for comparison and can be potentially applied to various fluids present at a small volume in the future. We found, that the saliva has high particle retention capacity that is comparable to the foot glue of the snail. To gain some insight into the properties of the saliva, we additionally studied it in the scanning electron microscope, estimated its viscosity in a de-wetting experiment, and investigated its elemental composition using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveling higher contents of Ca, Zn and other potential cross-linkers similar to those found in the glue."}
