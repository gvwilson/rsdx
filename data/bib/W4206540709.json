Members of this class include land snails, sea snails, freshwater snails, land snails, and limpet. In some countries, snails are often processed to be food. Along with the high consumption of snail meat, their shells' disposal rate, which can become waste on land and waters, is also high. This study aimed to determine the analysis method and benefits of the chemical compound content of several freshwater and land snail shells from the gastropod class. The method in this review was literary search from national and international journals. The result is known that the snail shell contains major chemical compounds, namely CaCO3, chitin, and chitosan. In addition, there are other minor compounds, such as minerals zinc, iron, copper, phosphorus, manganese, sodium, potassium, and proximate data. These compounds can be used as biomaterials that are useful for the world of health. Instruments for analysis of chitin and chitosan compounds can use FTIR spectrophotometry and mineral compounds of CaCO3 also; other minerals can use AAS and XRF."}
