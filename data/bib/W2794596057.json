Five years after their initial sightings, eradication efforts are still underway. A study was conducted to determine the upper and lower temperatures that giant African land snail can tolerate and survive. We observed 100% mortality at 2 °C and at 42 °C. Another study was conducted to ensure that dead snails and eggs collected during the eradication program will be buried at an appropriate depth with no risk of neonate emergence. We observed that hatching snails could dig through at least 81 cm of soil, but the maximum depth of soil from which they could emerge was not successfully determined."}
