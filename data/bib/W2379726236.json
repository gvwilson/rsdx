{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.mollus.a065701", "year": 1983, "abstract": "Monthly changes in the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of the shells of two annual species from Israel were investigated to elucidate the sources of the oxygen, carbon and calcium from which the shell is built. The observations showed that the oxygen, carbon and probably also the calcium are derived from the water that the snails either absorb through their skin or drink from the upper layers of the soil. There are seasonal fluctuations in both the oxygen and carbon composition of the shell. Fluctuations in oxygen isotope composition probably result from the fact that deeper soil water (richer in 180) rises to the surface during the summer months. It is suggested that fluctuations in shell carbon isotope are related to the seasonal effects of the metabolic activities of the ambient vegetation (such as spring rejuvenation of annual angiosperms) and the summer bloom of soil bacteria."}
