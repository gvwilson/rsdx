Therefore, to study the influence of environmental variation on the phenotypic diversity, we chose land snails, Trochulus hispidus and T. sericeus, characterized by high population variability. We performed long-term field studies as well as laboratory and common garden experiments, which revealed that temporal environmental changes generate visible variation in shell size and shape of these snails. Many shell measurements of T. hispidus varied significantly with temperature and humidity in individual years. According to this, the first generation of T. hispidus, bred in controlled laboratory conditions, became significantly different in higher spire and narrower umbilicus from its wild parents. Interestingly, offspring produced by this generation and transplanted to wild conditions returned to the 'wild' flat and wide-umbilicated shell shape. Moreover, initially different species T. hispidus and T. sericeus transferred into common environment conditions revealed rapid and convergent shell modifications within one generation. Such morphological flexibility and high genetic variation can be evolutionarily favored, when the environment is heterogeneous in time. The impact of climate change on the shell morphometry can lead to incorrect taxonomic classification or delimitation of artificial taxa in land snails. These findings have also important implications in the context of changing climate and environment."}
