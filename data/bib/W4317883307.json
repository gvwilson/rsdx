Objective: Substantial update of this knowledge, with the incorporation of new species to the regional inventory. Methodology: Updated review of cryptic regional malacological bibliography and taxonomic examination &amp; determination of specimens (vouchers) deposited in malacological collection of scientific museum. Results and conclusions: Incorporation of three (3) land/ terrestrial gastropod (forest snail) species into the previously established regional inventory, taxonomically grouped all into 1 genera and 1 family, bringing to 47 its your number of regionally land known forms."}
