We examined newly collected samples from several collection sites spread over nearly 20 000 km 2 of mostly inaccessible land, which represented all three currently known and three previously undescribed species. All species were initially identified as members of Mesodontrachia based on their similar, putatively typical shell. However, M esodontrachia as so delimited was polyphyletic in a mitochondrial phylogeny with respect to several other camaenid genera from NW A ustralia. Contrary to the shell, we found considerable variation in the penial anatomy that was consistent with the mt DNA differentiation. To retain monophyletic taxa, we propose a revised taxonomy whereby Mesodontrachia is maintained as a monotypic taxon. In addition, four genera ( N odulabium, O totrachia , P seudomesodontrachia and V incentrachia ) and three species ( P . gregoriana , O . compressa and N . solidum) are newly described. The shell of all these taxa is highly conserved and of little taxonomic utility. Shell similarity is attributed to a similar life style in a similar and harsh environment."}
