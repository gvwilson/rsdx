One hundred adult snails were subjected to the following two experimental conditions: (i) a starved group, provided with water; (ii) an antibiotic-treated group that was provided with a solution containing a mixture of two antibiotics. The antibiotic group exhibited a T(c) significantly lower than the starved group (-3.94 +/- 1.32 degrees C, n = 40 and -3.07 +/- 0.99, n = 30, t test, p < 0.005). This study showed that bacteria of the gut are likely to elevate animal supercooling points. It is also the first report in which a possible ice-nucleating activity of the gut microflora in a land snail has been suggested by the action of antibiotics on the T(c)."}
