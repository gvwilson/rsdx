We tested in the field whether adaptation to different habitats affects the endogenous levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in two closely related Sphincterochila snail species, a desiccation-resistant desert species, Sphincterochila zonata, and a Mediterranean-type, desiccation-sensitive species, S. cariosa. We examined HSP levels in various tissues of snails during aestivation and after resumption of activity. Our study shows that, during aestivation, S. cariosa had higher standing stocks of Hsp70 in the foot and the hepatopancreas, and of small HSPs (sHSPs) in all the examined tissues, whereas S. zonata had higher stocks of Hsp70 in the kidney and of Hsp90 in the kidney and in the hepatopancreas. Arousal induced a general upregulation of HSPs, except for Hsp90, the expression of which in the foot was higher during aestivation. We suggest that the stress protein machinery is upregulated during arousal in anticipation of possible oxidative stress ensuing from the accelerating metabolic rate and the exit from the deep hypometabolic state. Our findings support the concept that, in land snails, aestivation and activity represent two distinct physiological states, and suggest that land snails use HSPs as important components of the aestivation mechanism, and as part of their survival strategy during and after arousal. Our study also indicates that adaptation to different habitats results in the development of distinct strategies of HSP expression with likely consequences for the ecology and distribution of land snails."}
