D-alloisoleucine/L-isoleucine (A/I) values were determined for 260 individual shells from 29 proveniences, including sites in alluvium, colluvium, and rockshelters, as well as burned rock middens. A/I values show a good correlation with radiocarbon age, and so provide reasonably precise estimates of ages. Analyses indicate the presence of redeposited material in a large number of proveniences. These result from sedimentary processes involved in burial of the sites as well as from later disturbance (aboriginal or recent) of site stratigraphy. Because amino acid racemization analyses are relatively easy to carry out, this method lends itself to very detailed chronostratigraphic analyses of archaeological sites, thus permitting assessment of site integrity and assisting in the interpretation of site formation processes.
