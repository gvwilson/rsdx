Forty-two populations of Albinaria were analyzed, mainly A. turrita, A. caerulea and A. brevicollis, collected from 22 Aegean islands and certain surrounding regions. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses on 16S rRNA and combined datasets produced trees that share significant similarity and reveal a phylogeny with distinct branches which are in general, but not full, agreement with current taxonomy. The Aegean taxa are not monophyletic as a whole, since A. turrita does not cluster with A. caerulea and A. brevicollis. The latter form a distinct monophyletic cluster, within which two groups are evident. These groups do not readily correspond to currently accepted morphospecies; one contains the populations that inhabit the central part of the archipelago plus some eastern islands, while the other contains populations whose geographic distribution is restricted to the southeastern part of the archipelago. The divergence between these two groups is attributed to vicariance events that primarily shape contemporary distributions. Although dispersal may also be present, certain small- and large-scale vicariance events can be traced; alternative phylogeographic hypotheses are discussed in view of the historical biogeography of the region."}
