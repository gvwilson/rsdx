The present study aims at investigating the DNA damage in the land snail Helix lucorum as a biomarker of soil pollution. For this reason, the genotoxic impact of contaminated soil on H. lucorum, collected from different polluted areas, was investigated using the comet assay in haemocytes and digestive gland cells. An increase in DNA damage was found in the snails sampled from polluted sites compared with the reference one. Strong correlations between DNA damage in haemocytes and digestive gland cells with the level of contamination indicate pollution-induced genotoxic effects in both tissues. At the same time, the digestive gland was more sensitive towards pollutants compared with haemolymph. A direct relationship between concentrations of Cu, As and Mo in soil and the number of damaged cells for h–∞emolymph and digestive gland tissue was found. However, the data obtained reflect the total genotoxicity of all pollutants in the studied areas. Significant correlations between the DNA damage measured by the comet assay and metal contents in soil indicate that it is a suitable biomarker in ecotoxicological studies. Our results indicate the effectiveness of H. lucorum in biomonitoring of environmental pollution."}
