This study tested the physiological responses to combinations of desiccation and rehydration in a Mediterranean land snail, The ba pisana. Normothermic desiccation for three weeks resulted in about 10% loss of the initial whole snail mass. Extension of desiccation to five weeks resulted in a total loss of 14.2%. This mass loss resulted in depletion of the extra-pallial fluid compartment, while body fluid was closely maintained. Chloride and osmotic concentrations of the extra-pallial fluid increased significantly during desiccation, while urea concentration decreased significantly. When allowed to rehydrate for various time periods (48, 72, 96, and 120 h), the snails recovered all mass loss,..."}
