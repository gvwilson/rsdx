{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1645/21-3", "year": 2021, "abstract": "Snails identified as Triodopsis hopetonensis were collected (n = 18) from the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville campus in December 2018. Additional snails were collected in April 2019 (n = 9) and in September 2019 (n = 9). Kidney tissues were examined using light microscopy, and polysporocystic oocysts were observed. Sporulated oocysts (n = 2) measured 78 ± 3.4 μm × 76 ± 2.9 μm with an irregular oocyst residuum and contained an estimated 44-55 tetrazoic sporocysts. The sporocysts (n = 10) measured 13 ± 0.5 μm × 11 ± 1.5 μm with an indistinct, irregularly placed, sporocyst residuum and usually contained 4 sporozoites, although an octozoic variant was observed. DNA was extracted from the snail kidney tissues and used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was used to determine the infection status of the snails; 13 of 36 (36%) specimens were found to be infected with a new Klossia species, and only 3 (8%) of these infections were detected using light microscopy. The complete nuclear 18S ribosomal DNA (1,800 bp) and mitochondrial genomes (6,775 bp) were generated, and they differentiated this parasite from the type species Klossia helicina and support the description of this new Klossia species, Klossia razorbacki n. sp. This is the first Klossia species to be described from any North American snail."}
