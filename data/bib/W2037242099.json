In animals which were repeatedly injected with the same dose of morphine, tolerance developed. Injection of the opiate antagonist, naloxone, resulted in a gradual reversal of the morphine induced behavioral characteristics. In addition, the effect of morphine on locomotor activity can be considered biphasic. At higher doses morphine induced a state of muscular rigidity in the organisms whereas at lower doses the animals were hyperactive."}
