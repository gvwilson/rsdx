Four of the sites were grazed, intermittently to continuously, and three had been irregularly burned and mown. Snails that are characteristic of the dry, open conditions of chalk grasslands made up 28% to 94% of all individuals, and 33% to 75% of all species at the different sites. Open-country snails tended to be relatively more common at sites that had been consistently grazed than at sites that were mown or burned, although some heavily grazed sites showed low overall snail abundance. Sites varied with respect to turf height, the size of gaps in the turf, soil moisture, and higher plant species richness, but none of these site characteristics were good predictors of the proportion of open-country snails. Comparisons of fresh and old shells at any given site can indicate whether particular species have changed in relative abundance over time. No changes were evident at two sites, Wylye Down and Galley Hill, but three of nine species changed at Aston Rowant South, and four of ten species at Castle Hill. As a group, open-country snails declined relative to other snails at just one site, Castle Hill, which had been consistently grazed. This study confirms site-to-site variability in chalk grassland snail faunas, while finding faunal composition to be generally constant through time within each site. Thus, mechanical cutting and burning, as well as grazing, may be able to maintain habitat for some open-country British snail species."}
