Ten populations belonging to three clausiliid subfamilies were examined, focusing mainly on the Alopiinae. Special consideration was given to the Graciliaria-type clausiliar apparatus (GCA), whose homoplasious character is confirmed: the two approaches give congruent results after its exclusion. The present analysis indicates that phylogenetic relations, at least within the Alopiinae, have to be reexamined. In view of the above, a new classification for certain taxa is proposed."}
