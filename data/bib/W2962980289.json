The biochemical effects of two mullicicides; Agrinate and Biomagic were studied on two land snail species; Helicella vestalis and Theba pisana. The negative effects of sub-lethal concentration (1/4 LC50) of both mullicicides on aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total lipids and total proteins were assessed. Chemical assessments were carried out at Precise Chemical Analysis Component, Plant Protection Research Institute. Results showed that the two tested compounds inhanced, in general, the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in most periods after treatment, except at the 3rd day after treatment, as both pesticides achieved a decrease in enzyme activity in H. vestalis andalso at the 10th day in T.pisana. treatment as Agrinate reduced the activity of (AST). Activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was reduced in both snails, except at the 3rd day of treatment with Agrinate, while Biomagic increased (ALT) activity at the 3rd and7th days post-treatment, followed by a reduction towards the end of the test duration (two weeks). In addition, levels of total lipids (TL) and total proteins (TP) were reduced due to the application of Agrinate or Biomagic. Because enzymes, proteins and lipids are vital chemical compounds in all organisms, including land snails, it has become very necessary two assess their reactions towards mullicidal applications."}
