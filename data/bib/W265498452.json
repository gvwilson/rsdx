The field population in autumn consisted of two size classes: large snails of more than 10 mm in diameter and small snails of less than 5 mm in diameter. After the first rain, the large snails that emerged from aestivation laid eggs and died. After 3–4 weeks, a new cohort hatched and grew intensively throughout winter to the end of spring. However, a group of small snails ceased growing and entered an early aestivation. These growth-inhibited individuals retained immature size. Their proportion in the population is estimated at 5–10% throughout the year. The population in the laboratory showed a similar growth pattern and size distribution as that in the field. The inhibited-growth group in the laboratory was 40% of the population. We conclude that Theba pisana in Israel developed a strategy of mixed annual and biennial life ..."}
