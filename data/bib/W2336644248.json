{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.mollus.a065632", "year": 1982, "abstract": "Data, based on 8 monthly sets of random samples, are presented on the life histories, densities and biomass of snail populations in a mixed deciduous wood with moderately rich soil. Discus rotundatus, Oxychilus helveticus, O. cellarius and Trichia hispida have approximately annual life cycles, with rather little post-reproductive survival. Aegopinella nitiduta and Cochlodina laminata take two years to reach maturity, and adults of the latter may survive for several years. Breeding seasons are prolonged, but annual species peak in the autumn. Density does not vary much with season. Mean annual density of all species combined (37.m−2) is much lower than those recorded for similar woods elsewhere, but the estimate of mean annual standing crop (175 mg ashfree dry weight m−2) does not show the same discrepancy. Comparisons reveal that the main cause of low density is the absence or rarity of several very small litter-dwelling species which have little effect on overall biomass, and reasons for this are discussed."}
