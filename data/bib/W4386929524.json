The activity concentration of 137Cs in the their bodies increased over the first 40 days of the experiment, after which the increase in the activity of this radionuclide significantly reduced. The distribution of 137Cs in the body of a snail decreases as follows: gastrointestinal tract ˃ body = albumin gland ˃ shell. It was found that the contribution of soil towards the contamination of their bodies by 137Cs is far less than that of forage. Although the biological availability of Pb and U in forage is one order of magnitude higher than in soil, the main contribution to the contamination of snails originates from soil."}
