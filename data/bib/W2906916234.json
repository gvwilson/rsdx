Totally 86 specimens of H. aspersa and 67 specimens of H. lucorum were collected for this study in 5 April 2018. Parameters of the shell length and weight (W) relationship by using the formula W = aLb . The weight – shell height, weight – shell width and shell height - shell width results suggested that two helix species (H. aspersa and H. lucorum) showed negative growth characteristics (b&amp;lt;3, P&amp;lt;0.05). The shell height and shell width of H. lucorum was significantly (P&amp;lt;0.05) greater than the mean shell height and shell width of H. aspersa. The mean meat yield of H. lucorum was significantly (t-test, P&amp;lt;0.001) lower than the mean meat yield of H. aspersa. The present study can be use for future researches for cooperation to their results."}
