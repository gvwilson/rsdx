{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/425679a", "year": 2003, "abstract": "A land-snail species of polyphyletic origin results from chirality constraints on mating. A single gene gives rise to the mirror-image form of a snail's body plan, which could become established as a different species if mating is prevented between snails of different chirality by genital mismatch1,2,3. Here we use molecular phylogeny to demonstrate the parallel evolution of reversal between left and right lineages of the Japanese land snail Euhadra. We find that the different mirror-image forms have evolved in favour of the genetically dominant handedness as a result of single-gene speciation."}
