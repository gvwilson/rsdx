There is both short and long term memory of the aversive (quinine) experience, as well as habituation of climbing in snails encountering an apparently neutral (water) stimulus. Some of the factors which appear to influence climbing latencies and acquisition and retention of the nature of the goal stimulus are: length of laboratory housing, humidity and nutritional and reproductive condition."}
