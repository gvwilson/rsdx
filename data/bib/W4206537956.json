{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1163/18759866-bja10025", "year": 2022, "abstract": "Abstract Two new, extremely small land snail species, Angustopila coprologos Páll-Gergely, Jochum &amp; Hunyadi n. sp. and Angustopila psammion Páll-Gergely, Vermeulen &amp; Anker n. sp. are described from northern Vietnam and northern Laos, respectively. The former is characterized by a rough surface sculpture and bears tiny mud granules arranged in a pattern of radial lines on its shell surface. The latter species is the new global record-holder of the tiniest land snail title, with a shell width of 0.6–0.68 mm and a shell height of 0.46–0.57 mm. These measurements surpass the former records of Angustopila pallgergelyi and Acmella nana ."}
