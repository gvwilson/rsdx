{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/ts.197", "year": 2007, "abstract": "Abstract The changes that occurred in the reproductive system during the breeding season of the land snail Archachatina marginata ovum (Pfeiffer) were investigated from April to July 2005 in collections obtained from snail hunters. These changes were divided into four stages (juvenile stage, mating readiness, egg production and post reproductive), which are described. The observations on the changes in the reproductive organs of A. marginata ovum suggest that the adult population is vulnerable during the breeding season. Management guidelines that will enhance commercial production of the snails are discussed. Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd."}
