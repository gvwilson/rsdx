Field experiments showed that these assemblages were formed when snail abundance exceeded five individuals per 10 cm2. In these aggregations an average density of 2–3.5 snails per cm2 and a central density of 5–7 snails per cm2 were measured. The biomass ranged from 92 to 148 g/m2 AFDW. The Umbonium aggregations are conspicuous elevations which are generated by the snails fixing sediment with their mucus. During calm weather periods migration of the snail assemblages towards the sublittoral was observed. The formation of aggregations in Umbonium vestiarium prevents deportation from the tidal zone and is interpreted to be advantageous for filter feeding and reproduction."}
