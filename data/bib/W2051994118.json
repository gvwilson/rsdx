A study of amino acid racemization in the land snail sp. Cerion was inconclusive in resolving this, and therefore an investigation of the same species using ESR was undertaken. Sample ages range from 4 to 150 ka. The newer shells represent one of the youngest ESR sample sets known, and the first attempt to use terrestrial species. The ages obtained correlate generally with stratigraphic expectations, but until further work is done on the environmental history, the numerical values should be considered relative rather than absolute."}
