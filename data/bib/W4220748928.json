This operculated land snail of the family Cyclophoridae differs from its nearest congeners S. calyx and S. inglisianus in a combination of characters namely, a notched inner peristome, a wing-like extension at the outer peristome at the parieto-palatal region and a flatter shell. This is the first record of the genus Scabrina in Peninsular Malaysia, extending the known range of the genus 1,000 km southwards."}
