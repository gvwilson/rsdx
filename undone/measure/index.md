title: "Measure Percolate Properties"
tag: "Use remote storage for large files when measuring fractal dimension and density."
syllabus:
-   Saving fractals created by invasion percolation for analysis.
-   Using [DVC][dvc] to store those remotely instead of committing to version control.
-   Using those files to estimate fractal dimension and density vs. distance from centroid.
