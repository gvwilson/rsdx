{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1139/z87-465", "year": 1987, "abstract": "The influence of early feeding experience on egg cannibalism was examined in hatchlings of the land snail Arianta arbustorum. The propensity for cannibalism was not affected by cannibalistic or by vegetarian early feeding experience. It was, however, negatively correlated with the age of the snails. Freshly hatched snails with no prior feeding experience chose eggs exclusively, while 16-day-old snails preferred vegetable food. Furthermore, the cannibalistic propensity varied between offspring from different clutches. Restriction of the cannibalistic propensity to the hatchling stage, its nonmodifiability, and differences in its extent between clutches suggest that egg cannibalism in A. arbustorum is a genetically determined trait."}
