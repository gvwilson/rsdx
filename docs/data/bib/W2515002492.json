The purpose of this study is to grasp the reason why the structure has been functioning recruitment and growth of coral. As the results, it was suggested that the lattice structure in top-shell snail aquaculture structure functioned effectively recruitment of a coral larva. In addition, it was suggested that the measure-shaped structure functioned as to damp current speed at the time of the high surge and it has contributed to the growth of coral."}
