Studies have shown that diet and stocking density influence properties of the snail haemolymph. This study examines the haemolymph biochemical properties of the land snail, ( Archachatina marginata ) from south-west (Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun and Oyo). Organic (protein, lipids, glucose) and inorganic (Na, K, Ca, Cl, PO 4 ) composition of snails’ haemolymph were determined by standard methods. Results showed that GALS from Oyo state had the highest lipids and glucose concentrations in the haemolymph while Ondo and Ekiti states recorded the least. Protein was the most abundant (33.83g/l-49.37g) organic substance while lipids were the least (23.93mg/dl-33-93mg/dl). There were significant differences (P&lt;0.05) in the concentrations of inorganic substances in the haemolymph across the six states. Snails from Oyo state recorded significant higher (p&lt;0.05) concentrations of Na + , Ca 2+ and Cl - than those of other states. Also, Na+ and Cl- were the most common anions in snails’ haemolymph from the six states. This current study concluded that snails from Oyo state had better haemolymph biochemical properties than other south west states of Nigeria.
