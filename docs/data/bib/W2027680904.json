We performed Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses of concatenated nuclear (28S) and mitochondrial (COI, 16S) DNA sequences from 140 species of 37 of these genera plus an additional 27 extralimital species in order to resolve their phylogenetic relationships and to address the significance of morphological characters for the delineation of monophyletic taxa. While north-western Australian Camaenidae in their entirety are not monophyletic with respect to extralimital groups, they underwent extensive in situ-diversification in several independent phylogenetic radiations. A Maximum Likelihood-based character history reconstruction revealed extensive convergence in all studied shell characters and in three out of four genital features across this group. However, in some genera close morphological similarity is best explained by the retention of ancestral characters. We hypothesize that both morphological stasis in some groups and convergent character evolution in others can to a large extent be attributed to adaptive transformations in response to historically increasing aridity throughout north-western Australia in concert with structural constraints."}
