Charles Darwin thought that snails might cross oceans by hitching a lift on birds. There has been little direct evidence for this, and snail species that seemed closely related have been separated by taxonomists in part on the grounds of the oceans that divide them. But it looks like Darwin was right again: molecular methods reveal the spectacular transequatorial dispersal of the land snail Balea from Europe to the Azores and the Tristan da Cunha islands, and back again. Darwin was fascinated by the transportation of land snails across great swathes of open ocean by birds â€” he even immersed snails in sea water to see how long they would survive1. Here we follow a molecular phylogenetic trail that reveals the incredible transequatorial dispersal of the land snail Balea from Europe to the Azores and the Tristan da Cunha islands, and back again. This long-distance dispersal is unexpected for what are proverbially considered the most pedestrian of creatures."}
