Relative potency compared with Gastrotox were (0.75, 0.73, 0.56,  0.33,  0.21,  0.20, 0.12, 0.11, 0.10, 0.07, 0.04 and 0.03 times) for mention before compounds,  respectively.  Data showed that the percent reduction in population of Monacha sp. in field after 3 days (I.K) were (65.98, 63.44, 70.22 , 71.28 and 71.27 % ) Also, reduction percentages ( residue ) after 28 days were ( 91.39, 78.66, 94.65, 91.55 and 91.48 %) reduction for Agrinet, Kafrothrien, Gastrotox, Neomyl and Meserol, respectively."}
