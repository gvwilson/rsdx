To update the inventory of land snail species from Mt. Ciampea and to compare it with the previous records, we sampled land snails at eight plots (10m x10m) in January 2013 and May 2014. In total, 1702 specimens belonging to 16 families and 34 species were collected. Stomacosmethis jagori (Cyclophoridae) was the dominant species comprising 24% of the individuals. The number of species was similar to a previous survey, in which 38 species were recorded, but the species composition was different. Sixteen of the previously recorded species were not found in our survey, but we could record 13 species that were not known from Mt. Ciampea so far. Among them were two invasive species, Lissachatina fulica (Achatinidae) and Bradybaena similaris (Camaenidae) that colonized the area since the early 20th century. A more detailed survey will be necessary to ascertain whether and which previously recorded species are actually extinct on Mt. Ciampea."}
