From this samples six common and widespread species were identified and two further species recognised but not identified. The best represented species was Cepaea , with both C.hortensis (represented largely by its yellow unbanded form) and C.nemoralis present. Helix aspersa , C e rnuella virgata ?, Oxychilus allianus and Trichia hispida ? were also represented; of these H.aspersa was present in the greatest numbers. All of these species are now widespread and occupy a wide range of habitats."}
