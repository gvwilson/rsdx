Snail populations were sampled. The population increases correlated with lime dosages. In plots treated with 10tha-1, mean densities increased 4-40 times, depending on the species (5 years after liming). 3. There were highly significant correlations between snail density and pH, Ca concentration, base cation concentration and base saturation; however, the correlations between nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were very low. 4. The results indicate that liming positively effects land snail population densities in relatively nutrient-poor deciduous forests."}
