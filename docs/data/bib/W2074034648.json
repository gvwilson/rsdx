These thermoregulatory effects could be blocked and reversed by naloxone hydrochloride, with the opiate antagonist by itself (1 and 10 micrograms) causing a significant decrease in preferred temperatures. After 6-10 days of daily administration of morphine, Cepaea displayed tolerance, the effects of morphine decreasing and thermal preferences becoming similar to those of saline-treated individuals. These results suggest that an opioid system is involved in the control of thermoregulation in snails, in a manner that is similar to that shown by vertebrates."}
