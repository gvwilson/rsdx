Based on the results of our research and literature data, the reliability of some anatomical criteria that can be used to differentiate M. claustralis and M. cartusiana has been analyzed. A considerable variability in the length and shape of the vagina in M. cartusiana in Western Ukraine has been demonstrated, which may cause the erroneous identification of some specimens of this species as M. claustralis . The pattern of the present distribution of M. cartusiana in Western Ukraine are also characterized."}
