Scenarios involving Pliocene geological changes and postglacial expansion during the Pleistocene were proposed in previous studies to account for the establishment of this geographical structure. In the present work, we have performed a spatial analysis of variation in shell morphometrics, after the partitioning of the overall variation into size and shape components by means of a principal component-based approach (Cadima and Jolliffe, 1996). In order to know if the same historical events have also structured shell variation, the analysis includes all the populations from North Africa which were investigated for anatomical and molecular surveys. Contrary to shell size, which shows a significant spatial heterogeneity essentially related to environmental pressures, variation in shell shape components splits the populations according to a geographical pattern reflective of hypotheses suggested for molecular markers and genital anatomy. This implies that the selective forces often invoked to explain spatial changes in shell shape are not the deciding factors in the present case. Moreover, within each of the two geographical clusters defined, Mantel correlograms show that the similarity between populations declines according to an isolation by distance model. Because of the different allometric relationships between shell size and genitalia measurements in Western and Eastern entities of North Africa, mechanical constraints, possibly leading to a precopulatory isolation in the contact zone, are involved."}
