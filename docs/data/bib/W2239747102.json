We have demonstrated that R. decollata can only successfully kill C. aspersum that are <13 mm (shell diameter) and if given a choice between a known food plant (carrot roots) and C. aspersum within this vulnerable size range, the majority of R. decollata (∼93%) chose carrots. Adult R. decollata will feed on C. aspersum eggs and mean total consumption per individual was ∼3 eggs over a 7-day period. These experimental results support previous anecdotal suggestions that R. decollata may not be an effective snail predator."}
