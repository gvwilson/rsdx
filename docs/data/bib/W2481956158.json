Setobaudinia nicolasi n. sp. is endemic to Baudin Island, off the northwestern coast of Australia, where it occurs in sympatry with at least another three confamilial land snails. The new species is distinguished from other Setobaudinia species by a unique combination of features of its shell (low elevation and weak lip expansion) and male genitalia (inner penial wall sculpture of interlocking filaments).http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:10FAB5A9-503A-4E3B-A67C-772D85658C91"}
