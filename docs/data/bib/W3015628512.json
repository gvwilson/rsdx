The recent collection found 250 snails of 10 families (29 species). In the impacted area, 15 species (154 individuals) of land snails were discovered, whereas 18 species (96 individuals) were discovered in the unimpacted area. By a t-Student statistical analysis (95% confidence interval) for comparison between area of equal variances it was discovered that the two area differ significantly. The analysis was continued by using NMDS of PAST to show the difference more detail. This research proves that the snail assemblage in the impact area of eruption area were different with the snailâ€™s assemblage in the unimpacted other side of the Mount."}
