For this reason, a set of biomarkers was performed on land snails E. vermiculata collected from polluted and non-polluted areas in the field. The biomarkers used were lactate dehydrogenase activity, level of lipid peroxidation, activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and content of glutathione, metalothionines, total proteins and total lipid in the digestive gland tissue. The correlation between the bioaccumulation of heavy metal in gland tissue and all the biomarkers in the digestive gland was determined. The results revealed appreciable alterations in the biomarker values in field, accompanied by significant correlations among the biomarkers. Therefore, this study suggests E. vermiculata is a suitable sentinel organism and the selected biomarkers show efficacy for terrestrial heavy metal biomonitoring."}
