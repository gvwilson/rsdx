In an effort to understand the thermal tolerance and the impact of temperature elevation on tissue metabolism of land snails we determined the mortality, heamolymph PO2 and the activities of enzymes of intermediary metabolism in three land snail species (Helix lucorum, Helix pomatia and Cornu aspersum) differing in their geographical distribution and inhabiting areas with different climatic characteristics. No mortality was observed in both population of Cornu aspersum, while Helix pomatia exhibited higher mortality than Helix lucorum. PO2 dropped within the first 10 days of exposure to elevated temperature in all species, although in Cornu aspersum this decrease was significantly lower. No significant reduction in the enzymatic activities of all glycolytic enzymes studied, as well as of citrate synthase (CS) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD) was observed in the more thermal tolerant species C. aspersum from both populations studied. Significant reductions of enzymatic activity of the glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and d-Lactate dehydrogenase (d-LDH) was observed in Helix lucorum and Helix pomatia. The observed inter-specific differences seem to be in accordance with the life cycle characteristics of each species and may be attributed to climatic differences among habitats within their distribution range."}
