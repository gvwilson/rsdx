We wondered how common organisms would respond to near-future levels of CO 2 – levels that may occur by 2025. We chose two common but taxonomically and ecologically dissimilar organisms ( Theba pisana helicid snails and Adesmia dilatata tenebrionid beetles) to examine the behavioral effects of a slight rise (~10 ppm) of CO 2 on animal abundance and plant growth in the Negev Desert of Israel. We found that plots with supplementary CO 2 exhibited greater plant growth than control plots over a 50-day experiment, but increased growth did not alter beetle or snail numbers. In laboratory experiments with higher levels of augmented CO 2 paired with food rewards, we found that snails did not change their climbing behavior when presented with CO 2 alone, but they avoided food and climbed away when CO 2 was paired with food. Beetles in the laboratory were attracted to food regardless of CO 2 levels although high levels of CO 2 (1200–1300 ppm) reduced movement. The direct effects of near-future CO 2 levels may augment plant growth but have only minor influence on terrestrial snails and beetles. However, the effects of CO 2 on climate change in desert habitats like the Negev may be more severe due to a predicted rise in temperature and a decline in precipitation."}
