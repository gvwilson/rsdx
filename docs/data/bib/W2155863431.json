The colour intensity (a score of relative darkness) of the mantle collar, which is visible while the snail is retracted into its shell, was scored by matching to a colour atlas. Despite much within-population variation, among-population variation was significantly related to mean daily maximum temperature of the hottest month, as recorded at nearby meteorological stations. Climatic selection favouring pale colour in hot places is probably responsible for the association."}
