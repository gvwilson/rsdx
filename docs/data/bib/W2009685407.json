This snail is nocturnal and in the daytime prefers to rest in shrubs, often along the forest edge. The density was low in primary or secondary forests. The cumulative distance of movements of young adults was longer than that of old adults. They forage and mate in open fields. This behavior is likely to be a cause of serious damages to field crops cultivated next to the forest."}
