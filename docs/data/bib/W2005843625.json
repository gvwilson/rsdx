A total of 78 snails was collected in four out of 22 localities in VargemPequena neighborhood between August and December of 2005. In one of the localities (NovoHorizonte residential complex), two forms of nematode larvae were found, which were unsheathedand displayed oxyuroid esophagus. The large and stout form is a third-stage larva with a striatedcuticle and a short undulating tail. The small and slender form exhibited esophago-intestinaland intestinal valves. The prevalence of larval nematodes in A. fulica snails in Vargem Pequenaneighborhood was 4.8%. Additional studies are strongly recommended to identify the nematodespecies found and to determine whether this snail species constitutes a public health concern."}
