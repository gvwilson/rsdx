One of them, the monotypic genus Ridleyconcha Christensen, 2020, presents such an idiosyncratic shell morphology that, in the 130 years since its description, it has been variously allocated in unrelated families: Streptaxidae, Endodontidae, Charopidae, Camaenidae, and Scolodontidae. Herein, R. quinquelirata is included into a molecular phylogenetic framework of stylommatophoran land snails to clarify its taxonomic position. The analysis supports the latest morphological revision classifying Ridleyconcha in Scolodontidae. Considering the present sampling, Ridleyconcha appears to be the sister taxa of Entodina Ancey, 1887."}
