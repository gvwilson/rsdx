These involve the use of amino-acid epimerization analysis (D-alloisoleucine/L-isoleucine ratio, or A/I) and are illustrated by deposits of land snail shells. This method requires only very small samples, so shells can be analyzed individually. Mixed-age deposits are indicated when variation in A/I among individual shells within the deposit exceeds the analytical error. Methods are presented for 1) estimating the true time of deposition of slightly-mixed-age assemblages based on bulk 14 C dates and epimer analyses, 2) selection (for 14 C analysis) of a set of individual shells that are uniform in age and represent the true time of deposition, and 3) estimating ages of individual shells within a mixed-age deposit based on their A/I ratios."}
