The δ18O values of the waters assumed to be in isotopic equilibrium with the shell carbonate were calculated. These calculated δ18O values are more positive than the δ18O values of the average meteoric waters in the locales in which the snails lived. The 18O enrichment appears to be linearly related to the reciprocal of the local relative humidity, which is consistent with the notion that these ambient waters have undergone isotopic steady-state evaporation. Measurements of the δ18O values of ancient land snail shells from the excavation of Sudden Shelter (42SV6) at Ivie Creek, Utah, suggest that the climate at this site was probably warmer and/or drier around 7100–7800 BP than at present."}
