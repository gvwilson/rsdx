Mediterranea depressa (Sterki) was recorded for the first time in Turkey. Five species in the family Enidae were found on the island; the most unexpected one was Chondrus tournefortianus (Férussac) outside of its previously known range. The conchological and anatomical characteristics of the specimens identified as Meijeriella cf. raynevaliana (Bourguignat) are given and the associated taxonomic issues are briefly discussed. Anatomies of Monacha claustralis (Rossmässler), Orculella critica (Pfeiffer) and Oxychilus cyprius (Pfeiffer) are also presented. As expected, the land snail faunas of Bozcaada, the nearby islands of Gökçeada and Limnos and the mainland Turkey share some species. Some of the differences in the species compositions of these areas may be explained as results of human-mediated introductions."}
