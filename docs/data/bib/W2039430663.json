{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14772000.2013.877998", "year": 2014, "abstract": "Two new monotypic camaenid genera Cardiotrachia gen. nov. and Rachita gen. nov. are described for the two new species C. bastionensis n. sp. from the Bastion Ranges and R. carltonensis n. sp. from the Onslow Hills, respectively, in the East Kimberley, Western Australia. Cardiotrachia is characterized by distinct anatomical features, such as a small shell devoid of macroscopic sculpture with a peculiarly heart-shaped aperture and a coiled penis without epiphallus. Rachita is characterized by a shell flatter than that of any other camaenids of similar size from the East Kimberley, a lacking epiphallus and a complex penial wall sculpture. A mitochondrial DNA phylogeny corroborates the recognition of Cardiotrachia and Rachita as distinct genera with respect to other confamilial taxa from north-western Australia.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:60FA3A41-6A3B-4EBE-8B05-B7960B7EEEBF"}
