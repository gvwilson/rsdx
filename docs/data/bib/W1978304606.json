{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.2307/1935694", "year": 1973, "abstract": "Population characteristics of two species of land snails (Mesodon roemeri, Bulimulus dealbatus) were investigated in field and laboratory experiments. Field experiments consisted of transplantations of populations and artificial manipulations of temperature, moisture, and light levels in the two environments in which these species occurred. Results showed that the species which was part of an ecosystem with a more variable physical environment (and lower species diversity) exhibited a wider tolerance—niche, higher \"r\" value, shorter lifespan, smaller litter size, shorter developmental time, more general behavior relative to its habitat, more general food requirements, and smaller maintained biomass than did the species which occurred in a less fluctuating environment. Laboratory experiments confirmed field results on size of the tolerance niches and provided detailed description of the size—specific influences of the physical environment on the growth of Mesodon roemeri. The results are in agreement with a developing theory that relates environmental variability to ecosystem diversity and stability through these population properties."}
