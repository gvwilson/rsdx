Animal carrion is also consumed, and is usually composed of invertebrates like earthworms and other snails. However, while working at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in southwestern North Carolina in 2017, I observed a land snail (most likely Cepaea nemoralis [Grove Snail]) feeding on the carcass of a Desmognathus aeneus (Seepage Salamander), a vertebrate. This is the first report of a land snail feeding on an amphibian carcass in the United States. The Erratum for this article can be found in Southeastern Naturalist 19(3)."}
