{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/hdy.1988.98", "year": 1988, "abstract": "The land snail Theba pisana has a history of founder events on Rottnest Island, Western Australia. Compared with populations from the mainland source area, the island populations show a reduction of 30 to 50 per cent in allozymic variation, depending on the measure used. Similar reductions are associated with secondary founder events on the island itself. The implication is that random sampling has overwhelmed selection in the early history of these populations. From the decay of heterozygosity and the divergence among isolated colonies, the average effective population size over the first 20 to 30 generations of the founder populations was estimated to be about 35. On a larger scale, the genetic composition of T. pisana from Western Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania is consistent with a common source for the Australian introductions. Analysis of samples from southern France, Israel, and Wales supports the hypothesis that T. pisana consists of three genetically distinct geographical groupings: Britain, northern France (including some Welsh populations) and the Mediterranean area. Of the populations examined from the native range, only those from southern France have the genetic composition required of the source for the Australian introductions."}
