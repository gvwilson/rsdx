Thirty separate pairs of L. cailliaudi and twenty of A. sylvatica were reared to maturity in captivity. Six crosses of L. cailliaudi and four of A. sylvatica produced progeny and in both species the morphs segregated in a manner that suggests that absence of streaks is controlled by an allele recessive to one for their presence."}
