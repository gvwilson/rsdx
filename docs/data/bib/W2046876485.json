The land crab Gecarcinus lateralis is a significant predator of the abundant Bahamian land snails of the genus Cerion . The crabs typically ‘scissor’ the cylindrical shells in half or break the lip and peel back the shell to reach the animal which withdraws two or three whorls into the shell. Scars on shells of live adults at 73 sites in the Bahamas and Florida Keys show that about 8% (range: 0–44%) of the snails have survived attacks of this type. 2. An artificial crab claw was used to investigate the compressive force required to break Cerion shells of different morphotypes. Defining shell strength as the ability to withstand compressive forces, 10 morphotypes were found that exhibited mean relative strengths of between 30 and 300 newtons. Feeding trials with one adult crab showed that snails whose shells could withstand compressive forces of &gt; 95 N were safe from this individual predator. 3. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that both shell size (length and width) and shell wall thickness were the ultimate determinants of shell strength. Ribs strengthen the shell by contributing to wall thickness and also by increasing overall shell width. The thickened adult shell lip and collabral ribs provide effective protection from attack by peeling."}
