During normal feeding activity urea is usually undetectable in Bulimulus dealbatus, but with dormancy urea accumulates much faster than uric acid and to tissue levels of 260 Î¼m/g wet wt. 2. Since the incorporation rates of 14C-bicarbonate into urea and the activities of the ornithine-urea cycle enzymes are similar in active and aestivating snails, Bulimulus appears always to biosynthesize some urea. 3. The build-up of urea probably results from cessation of urination during aestivation and may be important in reducing evaporative water loss. The ornithine cycle clearly is an important metabolic pathway in this snail."}
