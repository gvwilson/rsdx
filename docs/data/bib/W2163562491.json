{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/mollus/eyt009", "year": 2013, "abstract": "Levels of variation within the mitochondrial CO1 gene were estimated in Oxychilus (Drouetia) atlanticus (sensu Morelet & Drouët, 1857) snails from across the island of São Miguel, Azores. 158 specimens from 23 localities were sequenced. Maximum uncorrected divergence was >10%, suggesting that there may be additional undescribed species. At the same time, a single widespread lineage was predominant across the island. This pattern of diversity did not relate to the geological ages of different regions of the islands, but is more compatible with an older geological estimate for the age of the island of around 4 Myr. Further studies of morphological variation and the use of nuclear markers are needed to determine the actual diversity of Drouetia on São Miguel and in the other islands of the Azores."}
