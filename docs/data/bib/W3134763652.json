A total of two hundred and forty African giant land snails (Archachatina marginata) with an average live weight of 177.69 Â± 10.87g were assigned to four dietary treatments: a maize-based diet (Diet 1) served as control, in a completely randomized design. The other diets were kola testa - based (Diet 2), corn bran-based (Diet 3) and rice bran-based (Diet 4) diets. The percentage of each test ingredient and that of maize was 31.30g/100g Each treatment consisted of sixty growing snails, which were subdivided into 3 replicates of 20 snails each. The snails received the diets over a period of 20 weeks. Weight gain was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) for the kola testa-based diet in comparison with the corn and rice bran-based diets. Depression of magnesium and iron in the shell, flesh and fluid of snails fed corn and rice bran diets was observed. The trial revealed that kola testa-based diet compared favorably well with the corn and rice bran-based diets."}
