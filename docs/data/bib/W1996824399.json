In the west are the foothills of the Talamanca mountain range (known as the Tasabara mountains in Panama), where very active volcanoes such as the Baru volcano have emerged. Panama forms part of a tectonic microplate resting on the Caribbean and Nazca plates. The center of the country, where the interoceanic canal was built, is also the most depressed, sunken part of the country. From this point to the east, Panama forms an arc ending with the Darien province, which connects the isthmus of Central America to the continent of South America."}
