Searches would be more effective if the density of live snails could be predicted from features of the habitat, or from the abundance of empty shells from long dead individuals. In 53 populations of Rhagada, the dominant genus of land snail in the Pilbara bioregion of Western Australia, the density of live snails is not correlated with the cover or height of spinifex (Triodia), the main habitat plant occupied by Rhagada. On the other hand, the density of empty shells on the soil surface does explain snail population density, but the relationship is weak (r2=0.209). Nevertheless, the data suggest that searches for live Rhagada are more likely to succeed in areas where empty shells are most abundant."}
