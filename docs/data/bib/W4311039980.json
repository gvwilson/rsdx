The morphological and molecular polymorphism of the two aforementioned subspecies has not been studied in depth. In this study, the polymorphism of snails of the two subspecies derived from seven snail farms throughout Greece was studied using morphological and molecular markers. Firstly, the snail samples of both subspecies were categorized in three shell patterns based on shell color and existence of bands. The conducted population structure analysis revealed three major clusters among the farmed snail populations. As concerns genetic diversity, six loci (Ha5, Ha6, Ha8, Ha9, Ha10, and Ha11) were tested for their polymorphism. Genetic variation was reported within populations rather than among populations. Finally, the obtained data highlighted a common gene pool broodstock for snail farms throughout Greece."}
