Fourteen species from various habitats of deciduous forest and limestone areas throughout Laos are confirmed. The classification is revised and discussed, based on material examined from Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand and after comparison with the type specimens in many museums. Two new species, A. (Amphidromus) syndromoideus Inkhavilay &amp; Panha sp. nov., from central Laos, and A. (Syndromus) xiengkhaungensis Inkhavilay &amp; Panha sp. nov., from northern Laos, are described and discussed."}
