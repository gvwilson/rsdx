Here, we combined whole-genome re-sequencing with population genomics to evaluate the historical demography and the speciation process of two closely related species of land snails from western Europe, Candidula unifasciata and C. rugosiuscula. Historical demographic analysis indicated fluctuations in the size of ancestral populations, probably driven by Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Although the current population distributions of both species do not overlap, our approximate Bayesian computation model selection approach on several speciation scenarios suggested that gene flow has occurred throughout the divergence process until recently. Positively selected genes diverging early in the process were associated with intragenomic and cyto-nuclear incompatibilities, respectively, potentially fostering reproductive isolation as well as ecological divergence. Our results suggested that the speciation between species entails complex processes involving both gene flow and ecological speciation, and that further research based on whole-genome data can provide valuable understanding on species divergence.
