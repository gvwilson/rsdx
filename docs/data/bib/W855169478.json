The species is mainly found on the kurkar ridges of the Coastal Plain, and is also known from a few scattered records from the northern part of the Negev Desert. The species turned out to be not identical with Multidentula ovularis, but a representative of the genus Euchondrus. A revision of the types and topotypical material of the recently described E. pseudovularis from the Negev revealed that the Israelian species known as Jaminia ovularis or Euchondrus aff. ovularis should be classified under E. pseudovularis. An overview is given of the history, ecology, taxonomy and distribution of this enid species endemic to Israel, and a list is given of the taxa that are currently classified within the genera Multidentula and Euchondrus."}
