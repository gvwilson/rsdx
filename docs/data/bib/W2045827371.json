{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0310.1999.00452.x", "year": 1999, "abstract": "We examined the effect of intermating interval on spermatophore size and number of sperm delivered in the simultaneously hermaphroditic land snail, Arianta arbustorum . Snails that remated after 6–7 d transferred smaller spermatophores which contained fewer sperm than snails that remated after eight and more days. This indicates that individuals of A. arbustorum need at least 8 d to completely replenish their sperm reserves after a successful copulation. We suggest that the interval between two copulations is also influenced by the energy costs of the long‐lasting courtship behaviour with extensive mucus production."}
