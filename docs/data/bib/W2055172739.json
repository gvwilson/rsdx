A study was carried out on the correlation between total mass (living weight), wet and dry biomass, shell weight and opercular linear dimensions in a sample of Ampullaria canaliculata from southern Brazil. 2. 2. A set of linear regression equations were derived, allowing estimation of mass eaten by predators, from shell weight or opercular dimensions. The equations also permit evaluation of standing biomass in the field. 3. 3. It is possible to identify females in advanced stages of egg maturation using the live weight and the linear dimensions of the opercula."}
