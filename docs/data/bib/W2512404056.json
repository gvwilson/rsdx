Similar results were obtained in both studies and showed that maximum daily air temperature was the single most important factor controlling snail activity. With declining (23°C to 13°C) temperatures, snail movement was significantly reduced from more than 40% of the sample at temperatures >15°C to 12% at 14°C. Under an increasing regime (0°C to 18°C) dormancy was broken near 11°C in some trials and at 14°C in others. Oxygen consumption rates of warm‐adapted (23°C) and cold‐adapted (0°C) snails were tested at 6, 16 and 26°C. At 6°C, cold‐adapted snails consumed less oxygen than did warm‐adapted snails, but the reverse was true at 26°C. These results suggest that temperature plays a major role in the activity and dormancy of L. irrorata and that the observed dormancy can be classified as true hibernation. In the temperate extension of L. irrorata's range, hibernation is probably an adaptive mechanism which is used to conserve energy when grazing activity and prédation pressure are reduced.
