Laboratory studies demonstrate the existence of an endogenous component for these rhythms. The effects of the environmental factors on the snail activities are multiple: light/dark and cold/warm cycles synchronise the behavioural rhythms; a masking effect is observed when it rains since the animals are active throughout the 24 h day; high temperature and low relative humidity cause a complete cessation of activities. In addition, social interactions between and within species can modulate the shape of the rhythms driven by the biological clock.
