Within the last few years, snail farming started to become a very popular activity in Romania too. It represents an ecological type of agricultural activity that can also be certified as biological, organic farming if the soil’s conditions and the technology are as such. Extensive amount of research offers details on the physiology of the edible snail species as well as regarding their biochemical content and their nutritional value. No much research reflects snail’s ability to bioaccumulate selenium. In the same time, a lot of research demonstrated the snail’s ability to accumulate contaminants such as heavy metals. Using fluorimetric analysis, we investigated selenium accumulation in meat and shell of edible terrestrial snails Helix pomatia and Eobania vermiculata Muller gathered from different regions of Moldova Republic, Ukraine and Russia. The meat selenium concentration in terrestrial snails reflects the ability of those invertebrates to accumulate high selenium contents. Based on the intake recommendations, snails can be a very good source of selenium for human consumption. Depending upon the soil mineral content and level of contamination, the snails will accumulate large quantities of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, therefore making the snails a very high-risk food product. Therefore, it is very important a careful selection of the agricultural land designated for snail farming. Additives containing selenium may be a way to supplement snail’s diet."}
