Pfeiffer, 1852) in the host plants was assessed in selected sites of West Bengal, India. In course of a survey, the collection of K. barrakporensis from randomly selected plants was accomplished for the purpose of highlighting – (a) distribution in host plants, (b) variation in abundance in different height and (c) the dispersion pattern. Although the snails were observed in seven different plants, the presence was more prominent in the lemon plant (Citrus limon), with an average of about 24 individuals / 100 leaves. The logit based principal component regression indicated significant differences in the choice of the host plants with abundance in C. limon followed by Hibiscus rosa sinensis and Nyctanthes arbor-tristis, which was further substantiated through ANOVA (F(1),6, 69 = 10.918; P &lt; 0.001). The heterogeneity in the distribution of K. barrakporensis at different heights of the plant C. limon was also observed with maximum abundance at about 90cm height with least number of snails at the ground level (F(1)6,139 = 3.797;P &lt; 0.0001). On the basis of the variance to mean ratio (s2/m = 1.847±0.161SE), negative binomial aggregation parameter k (1.034± 0.33 SE) and Lloyd mean crowding (ṁ) (1.083 ± 0.16SE) the dispersion of the snail appeared to comply with the clumped distribution in host plants. Apparently, the micro land snail K. barrakporensis exhibited clumped distribution in selected plant species that serve as the preferred resource and complies with the arboreal adaptation. However, further studies should be initiated on the resource preferences of the micro snail K. barrakporensis, to support conservation initiative and spread beyond native habitats."}
