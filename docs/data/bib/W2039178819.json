Three of the localities were former strip mines. Species richness did not correlate significantly with forest patch size, proximity of the traps to the forest edge, or mining history, but species richness of slugs was greater in forests containing Quercus (oak). Pallifera fosteri F.C. Baker, 1939 is a first record for Tuscarawas County. Of the slugs, 24 of 58 individuals (41%) were species of the uncommonly encountered genus Pallifera. Future studies should evaluate whether propylene glycol is useful for attracting Pallifera species."}
