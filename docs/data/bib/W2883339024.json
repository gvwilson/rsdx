The spatial differentiation of H. striata, due to the special features of its biology, is the highest among other terrestrial mollusks of the studied region. Populations with a low variability and weak gene pool differentiation are demonstrated to be the most vulnerable. The methodological importance of the intrapopulation structure of the species is specifically noted for the works on estimating the state of the population’s gene pools, since the single datasets of individual demes cannot demonstrate the true nature of the genetic structure of the populations."}
