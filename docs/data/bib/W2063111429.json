Decreasing daylength from 16 to 12 hr depresses significantly mean supercooling points (SCP) and water content of Helix aspersa MÃ¼ller. 2. There is a significant correlation between SCP and water content but for the same water content, SCPs of the snails submitted to a 12L-12D photoperiod were lower. 3. Helix aspersa is freezing susceptible but tissue damage is much more significant in long day snails than in short day ones."}
