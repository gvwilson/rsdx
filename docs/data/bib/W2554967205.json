Snails were treated with different concentrations of chlorfluazuron as contact and bait techniques. LC50 value was calculated after 7 days of treatment. The effect of LC50 value of the compound was studied on the reproductive system of snails after 7 days of treatment. The effect of the compound was evaluated as a spray under field conditions compared with methomyl (MALR recommended compound). The results revealed that chlorfluazuron was more toxic when used as a contact than as bait. LC50 for the contact was 1528.0 ppm and 1992.5 ppm for the bait. On the other side, chlorfluazuron induced malformation on the organs of reproductive system of snails compared with untreated animals. It caused severe swelling in the size of penis, vagina, sperm oviduct and albumen gland, and in the ovotestis the eggs were absent. Under field conditions, the compound achieved good results as it gave 78.7% reduction in snail population. Although this value was less than methomyl (94.4%), chlorfluazuron could be considered satisfied compound to be used in control programs of land snails."}
