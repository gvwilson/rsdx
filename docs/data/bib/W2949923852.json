D. laetifica sp. nov. occurs in an area stretching from just west of Eungella, southward through the Denham Range to Pine Mountain, south-east of Nebo, while D. leichhardti sp. nov. is hitherto known only from the more westerly Carborough Range. A third species Denhamiana sp. nov. ‘Dipperu’ is proposed awaiting more specimens. These camaenids are characterised by a combination of morphological features including a large helicoid shell with bold dark brown spiral bands and dark brown apertural lip, a closed umbilicus and a reproductive system featuring a reduced epiphallus, a short vestigial epiphallic flagellum and a cylindrical, sheathed penis that internally has a penial stimulator and triangular verge. Molecular study of one of the species indicates that the genus is a sister group to Bentosites Iredale, 1933 whose species occur in coastal and sub-coastal rainforests in localities between Ayr and Sarina, mid-eastern Queensland."}
