This species was first described based on material from two locations in New South Wales, “Upper Clarence River at Guy Faux Station” and “Upper Richmond River, at Cowlong”. These two locations are about 230 km apart from each other while all type material is considered to be lost. Comparative morpho-anatomy of specimens collected in the proximity of both type localities shows that the original concept of Helix porteri is based on two distinct species. Here we designate a neotype for this species from the Upper Richmond River area and provide a detailed redescription in order to remove any ambiguity about the identity of Austrochloritis porteri. Material from the vicinity of the second site mentioned in the original description of H. porteri, Guy Fawkes Station, is identified as Austrochloritis speculoris Shea & Griffiths, 2010. We describe key diagnostic features distinguishing both species."}
