Consistent evidence from mark-recapture studies and analysis of size-frequency distribution indicates an average annual increase in shell diameter of 3.6 mm, with an average period of 5 years from hatching to reach adult size. These rates are low, compared with most other land snails studied, including cama-enids from wetter environments. Estimates of mortality rate and the rate of recruitment into the adult population indicate that the snails live an average of approximately 5 years after reaching adult size, which means that the period of turnover for this population is approximately 10 years. The population density was estimated to be 0.8 adults per m2, with a total population size (± s.e.) of 875 ± 164. The population is very localised, with an estimated diameter of the neighbourhood area of only 38 m."}
