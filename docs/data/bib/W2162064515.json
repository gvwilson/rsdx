In March of 1992, we sampled T. funiculosus in Bahia Binners and Bahia Blanca, Socorro Island, Revillagigedo Archipelago, using 25 m2 quadrants. We found that total length varies between 3.0 and 85 mm, proportional weight between 3.0 and 228 g, and density between 6.21 and 9.87 ind/m2. The largest organisms (over 50 mm) contain 30.6% of soft parts. Porcelain snail populations remain unexploited on Revillagedo Archipelago and could be a potential resource under an adequate management strategy."}
