Beyond the use of mucus in movement and adhesion, the wide array of chemicals in mucus allows for supplemental use in communication. This communication is apparent in trail‐following behavior. This study addresses the potential communication via mucus in selecting resting sites in a laboratory assay. In a series of six experiments, individuals of Cornu aspersum (which often rest on above‐ground surfaces) were placed into lidded plastic containers with three or four sections swabbed with water (the control) or mucus, which included the test snail's own mucus, mucus from conspecifics from the same or a different container holding snails from the same lab colony, or from a different colony, and mucus from three additional snail species. The resting location was recorded on the following day. In two additional experiments, the facultative predator Rumina decollata was tested against conspecific and other snails' mucus. Individuals of C. aspersum preferentially rested in areas with the mucus of familiar conspecifics over mucus of unfamiliar conspecifics, a behavior that may contribute to homing and aggregation behaviors. There was evidence that juveniles may be less selective than adults. The mucus of only one of the three other species was avoided by individuals of C. aspersum . Unlike individuals of C. aspersum , individuals of the predator R. decollata avoided the mucus of conspecifics, which may be associated with less need for mate‐finding in this self‐fertilizing species. Individuals of R. decollata did not select among potential prey species."}
