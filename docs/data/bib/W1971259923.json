The goal of this laboratory study was to determine development and reproductive patterns in B. tenuissimus. Recently hatched individuals in seven groups of 10 were maintained in the laboratory for two years. To test for self-fertilization, 73 additional individuals were isolated. After 180 days the isolated snails showed no signs of reproduction. Subsequently, 30 of these snails were paired to test fertility. We noted the date and time of egg-laying, the number of eggs produced, the number of egg-layings per individual, the incubation period and hatch success. This species shows indeterminate growth. Individuals that were maintained with others, as compared to isolated individuals, laid eggs sooner, laid more eggs and had a greater hatching success. This species can self-fertilize, however, with lower reproductive success. Bulimulus tenuissimus has a well-defined reproductive period that is apparently characteristic for this species."}
