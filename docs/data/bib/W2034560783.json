Urease (EC 3.5.1.5, urea amidohydrolase), purified 160-fold from Otala hepatopancreas tissue aggregates into high molecular weight components in the absence of thiols; in the presence of thiols, one molecular weight species of 262,000 daltons predominates. 2. 2. Direct microprobe analysis of the enzyme separated on polyacrylamide gels revealed the presence of nickel, indicating that it is a nickel metalloprotein. 3. 3. Otala urease stoichiometrically hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide and hydroxyurea to hydroxylamine, ammonia and carbon dioxide. 4. 4. Otala urease shows a pH optimum between 8.4 and 9.0, depending upon the buffer used, and a high affinity for urea (Km 0.1 mM). 5. 5. The enzyme is reversibly inhibited by acetohydroxamate and Î±-halogenated acetohydroxamates."}
