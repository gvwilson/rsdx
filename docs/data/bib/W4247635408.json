Pfeiffer, 1828) was recorded at two isolated localities in Marienbad and close to the village of Štítary in the foothills of the Český les Mts. (West Bohemia). While only a single specimen was recorded along a blind railway line near the railway station in Marienbad, the locality by Štítary hosts a rich viable population in rocky steppe vegetation with shrubs at a xeric south-facing steep slope. Further searches in Marienbad were not positive in 2012 and 2013. However, future research is needed to understand if the species occurrence was only accidental or if a stable population lives there. The site Marienbad represents the westernmost record throughout the entire species distribution area and also the location at the highest altitude in the Czech Republic."}
