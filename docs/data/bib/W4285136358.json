We have modelled the presence-absence data collected in a sample area, related to this species, the congener C. depressus with which it can hybridise and the small snail Chilostoma glaciale, specific prey of Carabus cychroides. The models were projected to three future periods according to four greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The results indicated the future increase in niche and spatial overlap of the two beetles, which could lead to more hybridisation and competition between them. If these threats occur over the entire geographic range of the already endangered C. cychroides, they could accelerate its predicted decline in the coming decades due to climate warming."}
