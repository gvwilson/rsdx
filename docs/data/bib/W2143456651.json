Past surveys showed that these habitats harbor rare plant species, including endemics to Turkey. To further evaluate the conservation value of these habitats, especially in terms of the often neglected invertebrates, one limestone area to the north of Küçükçekmece Lake and surrounding Sazlidere Dam was surveyed for land snails. Our findings strengthen the case for the protection of these unique habitats. Twenty­-four species of land snails were identified in the survey area. Of these, 21 are native to Turkey, including three whose type location is Istanbul. In addition, two species that are at or near the limits of their ranges are considered to represent peripheral populations that may be especially worth conserving. Although the area surrounding Sazlidere Dam is under protection, the other limestone habitats are severely threatened by ongoing development."}
