The number of sperm transferred ranged from 802 620 to 3 968 800 (X= 2 185 100;N=91), but was related neither to the mating history of the partner nor to copulation duration. This indicates that individuals ofA. arbustorumare not able to adjust sperm expenditure to the mating history of the partner. Furthermore, the number of sperm transferred was correlated neither with the size of the donor nor with the size of the recipient. It has been proposed that the sexual conflict between the two genders in simultaneous hermaphrodites could be resolved by gamete trading. Theory predicts that sperm trading should occur in hermaphrodites in which the female role controls fertilization, for example in gastropods with a gametolytic gland and/or sperm storage such asA. arbustorum. To see whether sperm trading occurs, we also examined whether individuals ofA. arbustorumadjust the number of sperm they release to the number they receive from their mating partner. There was a high degree of reciprocity in spermatophore transfer: in 45 of the 46 mating pairs investigated both partners delivered a spermatophore that contained spermatozoa. The numbers of sperm transferred by the two mating partners were not correlated, however. This indicates that sperm trading does not occur in this simultaneously hermaphroditic land snail."}
