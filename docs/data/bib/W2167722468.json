The main goal of this work was to determine the efficacy of methaldehyde\u0002 Ferricol, Snail repellent tape and Snail repellent paint (Sabzrang) on this pest. Methaldehyde, Ferricol were used as bait around citrus trees and Snail repellent tape and Snail repellent paint rolled up around main stem of the citrus trees. The life snails on citrus trees were monitored at 2, 15, 29, 36, 68 and 98 days after treatments. Analysis of variance showed that there were significant differences between treatments and control, and also significant differences were found among treatments (p 91.87 and 82.63%, respectively; also the total control efficacies of the Snail repellent tape and Snail repellent paint were 95.22 and 82.26%, respectively, after 2, 15, 29, 36, 68 and 98 days of post treatment. Therefore the Snail repellent tape and methaldehyde were better than the other treatments for the management of land snail population."}
