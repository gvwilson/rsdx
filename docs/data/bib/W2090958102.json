In an introduced colony in Western Australia, the frequency of effectively unhanded shells is higher in exposed habitats than in adjacent thickets of Acacia bushes. This association holds for both unhanded shells and banded shells without upper bands. These results are most easily explained in terms of climatic selection."}
