Poly dA was easily digested under the conditions with a high salt concentration (150 mM), under which it was scarcely attacked by pancreatic DNase I, spleen DNase II, and staphylococcal nuclease. Other homopolymers such as poly dC, poly dG, and poly A were not attacked by the preparation. It was suggested that the DNase preparation contained a new enzyme, poly dA hydrolase or adenylodeoxyribonuclease. The substrate specificity of the preparation was compared with that of DNase I, DNase II, and staphylococcal nuclease."}
