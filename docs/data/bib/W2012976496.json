Therefore, it is of interest how parasites may affect their invertebrate hosts and how hosts can manage the detrimental effect of infections. In the present study, the naturally widespread parasitic mite Riccardoella limacum, which has been suggested to play an important role in the ecology of the land snail Arianta arbustorum, was artificially transferred to A. arbustorum. We experimentally examined the effect of the parasite on the food consumption, shell growth, and survival of its host. Surprisingly, we found minor impacts in some traits, i.e. we found that infected and uninfected snails similarly completed their shell growth, attained sexual maturity, and allocated equal energy into their albumen glands. However, infected snails consumed less and showed a significantly higher mort..."}
