{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.4039/ent1071111-10", "year": 1975, "abstract": "Abstract A female rove beetle ( Ocypus olens Müller) in the laboratory consumed 20 small-sized brown garden snails ( Helix aspersa Müller) in 22 days, eating almost its weight in snail bodies daily. H . aspersa is a serious agricultural and residential plant pest. Field observations from an area where O . olens was well established had a smaller snail population than similar areas lacking the beetle. O . olens appears to be a promising candidate species for biological control of H . aspersa . Mass production of O . olens has not yet been attempted. A tabular key to the nearctic species of Ocypus is presented. In North America its distribution is limited to California for which a map is included."}
