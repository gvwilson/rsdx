Populations from Massachusetts and Delaware were more resistant to freezing than were the animals from South Carolina. Patterns of cold acclimation also differed among the populations. Mass mortality in local populations of Melampus from South Carolina was observed during the severe winter of 1976–1977 but not during the winter of 1977–1978. Transfer experiments showed that snails from South Carolina could not resist the winter in Massachusetts and had reduced survival compared to native animals in Delaware. Delaware animals survived in Massachusetts but were compromised in their reproductive potential. It is suggested that M. bidentatus is represented by at least two physiological races and the southern populations are limited in their range expansion at least in part by low temperature."}
