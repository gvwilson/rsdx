Very low values were measured in the snail shell (0.001–0.020 μg g‐1 d.w.), while in the soft tissue values (0.03–0.72 μg g‐1 d.w.) comparable to those present in the plants were observed.The high mercury levels (0.20–5.97 μg g‐1 d.w.) found in the snail gut seem to indicate the presence of a detoxification mechanism preventing the bioaccumulation of the metal. However mercury is transferred by the snail to the subsequent levels of the food chain."}
