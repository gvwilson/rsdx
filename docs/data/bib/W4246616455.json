{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/130760c0", "year": 1932, "abstract": "THIS laboratory manual on the snail now studied in most eastern universities as a type of gastropod mollusc is itself a model of what such a book ought to be. It is well illustrated, and contains not only a description of the anatomy of the subject and practical directions for its dissection, but also a synopsis of the eight Indian species of the genus Pila, and some interesting bionomical notes. From these it is plain that the apple-snail is the most versatile of the gastropodsâ€”or indeed, of all Mollusca. Usually a denizen of fresh-water, it can, in the case at least of P. globosa, tolerate that which is brackish; usually vegetarian, it may eat dead animal matter. It has both aquatic and aerial respiration at its command; it can swim as well as crawl in water, and yet can travel overland and even climb trees, while it lays its eggs on land, and specimens left dry in a cupboard rivalled the celebrated desert-snail of th British Museum by being found alive after five years."}
