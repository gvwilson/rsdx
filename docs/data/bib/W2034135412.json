The other species involved resemble the dark morph. This possibility was tested by comparing the composition of samples from two genera of mangrove trees which differ in their likelihood of having the alternative species on the leaves. The results showed the same pattern. This is a systematic effect on morph frequency, possibly selective predation, because the colonies on the different species of trees are drawn from the same larval population."}
