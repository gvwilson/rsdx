Allometric relationships between these variables are described, concentrating on the relationship between foot surface area and weight. Intraspecific foot area/weight relationships deviate from isometric expectation for several species; this may be attributed to density changes, foot-shape variation or the physical constraint imposed by shell aperture size.\r\n\r\nThe rate of increase of foot sole area with live weight among species is greater than expected under isometry, indicating that larger species partially compensate for the increase in foot loading (weight per unit foot area). The rate of whorl expansion of the shell is related to the deviations from the interspecific foot area/weight relationship, reinforcing the possibility that shell aperture area may limit foot size in some species. Foot ratio (foot length:foot width) is negatively related to live weight and foot loading.\r\n\r\nThe findings are discussed in relation to the known behaviour and microdistribution patterns of the species."}
