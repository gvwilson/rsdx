Morphological data (shell and anatomy biometry on different geographical scales) and partial sequences from mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase subunit I, 16S rDNA) were used to test whether morphological patterns match phylogeny in a diversified group of Sicilian rock-dwelling land snails belonging to the genus Marmorana. The taxonomic implications of the three character sets (shell and anatomical biometry and molecular data) were also considered. The inferred phylogenetic relationships do not match morphological (shell and genitalia) patterns. This result may significantly modify the current taxonomy. Mitochondrial based reconstructions define several supported clades well correlated with geographic distribution and populations were found to be distributed parapatrically. The progressive decline in mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity over a distance of 250 km is consistent with a model of isolation by distance, a pattern previously recognized for other groups of land snails. For one clade of Marmorana, colonization along Mediterranean trade routes appears to be a possibility."}
