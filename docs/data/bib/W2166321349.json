The tracks of snails crawling on the walls and on the bottom of an aquarium were recorded visually under various conditions of snail feeding. The following results were obtained. In the absence of food, the snails exhibited diurnal changes in locomotor activity, with a maximum during the day. Horizontal tracks on the aquarium walls were commonest during the day and vertical ones at night. When crawling on the aquarium wall, the snail actively stabilized its horizontal or vertical orientation: when encountering an obstacle or after a forced turn, the snail re-established the initial direction of locomotion. When fed on the water surface, the snail decreased its locomotor speed if food particles entered its mouth. The decrease in speed resulted from the slowing down of ciliary beating in the anterior part of the sole of the foot. This finding demonstrates that motor activity in different parts of the ciliated epithelium can be controlled independently by the nervous system. When searching for food particles, the snail exhibited very sinuous tracks, the turns occurring spontaneously at irregular intervals. This finding shows that there is a programme of ‘looping’ in the nervous system. When the snail was fed on the bottom near a vertical wall, it used the wall to climb to the water surface for lung ventilation. After ventilation, the snail performed a standard 180° turn and then returned to the food along the original outward track. Motion along a track was performed with high accuracy. The locomotor apparatus of a snail allowed it to crawl not only on a flat surface but also along the very thin mucus thread that it makes."}
