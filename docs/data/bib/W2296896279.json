Age anomalies are similar for the two species; they average +700 yr and vary by ±180 yr (1σ) among samples. Serial analysis of 1 shell reveals a significant ontogenetic trend in 14 C age anomalies, with older apparent ages (up to 1200 yr) in the apical part of the shell and younger and uniform ages in the last whorl. No trend in age anomalies was found across a broad range of rainfall conditions (from 300 to 1000 mm mean annual rainfall)."}
