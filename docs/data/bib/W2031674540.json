{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1086/659123", "year": 2011, "abstract": "Immune defenses have been shown to be heavily involved in the evolution of physiological trade-offs. In this study, we compared the internal defense systems in two subspecies of the land snail Cornu aspersum that exhibit contrasting life-history strategies. The “fast-living” Cornu aspersum subsp. aspersa is widespread throughout the world, especially in ecosystems disturbed by man, whereas natural populations of the giant Cornu aspersum subsp. maxima, characterized by a longer life span, are present only in north Africa. Snails were experimentally challenged with Escherichia coli; the measurements used to assess their internal defense for cell- and humoral-mediated immune responses were bacterial clearance, hemocyte density, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and plasma antibacterial activity. Both subspecies showed a similar ability to clear bacteria from their hemolymph; however, they varied in the robustness of different individual immune components. Cornu aspersum aspersa had higher ROS activity than did C. a. maxima and lower plasma bactericidal activity. These results suggest that ecological factors can sculpt the immune response. One interpretation is that shorter life span selects for immune defenses such as ROS that, although effective, can cause long-term damage. Such different immune patterns obviously entail various costs involved in the strong intraspecific variation of life-history trade-offs we previously observed. We also have to consider that such variation might be related to intraspecific differences in the relative strength of resistance and tolerance mechanisms."}
