They are situated 6.2 km west of Point Spring, Weaber Ranges and about 42 km north-northeast of Kununurra, Kimberley, Western Australia. C. kessneri has the most modified shell of any species belonging to the Ningbing Range-Jeremiah Hills camaenid land snail radiation. Its genitalia also has modifications that correlate with the small size of both the shell and the limestone hillocks on which it lives."}
