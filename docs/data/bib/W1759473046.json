Use in scientific research of biogeographic maps for assessment of biological diversity of individual groups and territories today is a very important technique that is widely used by many researchers. The object of this study was elected phyletic compact group of land snails, characterized by stringent strictly confined to a particular environment and a poor ability to overcome geographical barriers, which makes it very convenient model when conducting ecological and zoogeographical studies. Methods. In work was used the method of blending the modern habitats of the terrestrial mollusk fauna on paleokarst Caucasian Islands Paleogene-Oligocene period. The family Clausiliidae Gray, 1855 was chosen for analysis , as occupying a leading position in species composition relative to other families of mollusks in the Caucasus. Results. The analysis of the propagation of biological diversity of land snails Caucasian family Clausiliidae using the method of «overlay areas», showed a high percentage of the study group attachment to the Caucasus paleo islands - 79% or 50 species from 20 genius are placed within them, while 8 species from 6 genius paleo island found near the borders, and 5 species belonging to 4 genius, marked a considerable distance. Main conclusions. The results demonstrate the ability to use the group of land snails as a model for the study of correlations and paleogeographic reconstruction of the events of the Caucasus Isthmus"}
