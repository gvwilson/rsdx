It is formed by rocks of the teschenite association. It was opened as relatively small picrite quarry with further enlargement due to gravel mining up to present status. Quarries in general possess wide range of habitats. Moreover, teschenite rock association with its high calcium content is favourable environment for land snails. Altogether, 27 land snail species were found in Hončova Hůrka hill, of which four are concerned as near threatened (Ena montana, Vertigo pygmaea, Daudebardia rufa and Pupilla muscorum). This site thus has a potential as local refugium for endangered species and deserves our attention."}
