Yet, despite its high diversity, the number of whole genomes publicly available is still scarce. Here, we present the draft genome assembly of the land snail Candidula unifasciata , a widely distributed species along central Europe, which belongs to Geomitridae family, a group highly diversified in the Western-Palearctic region. We performed a whole genome sequencing, assembly and annotation of an adult specimen based on PacBio and Oxford Nanopore long read sequences as well as Illumina data. A genome of about 1.29 Gb was generated with a N50 length of 246 kb. More than 60% of the assembled genome was identified as repetitive elements, and 22,464 protein-coding genes were identified in the genome, where the 62.27% were functionally annotated. This is the first assembled and annotated genome for a geometrid snail and will serve as reference for further evolutionary, genomic and population genetic studies of this important and interesting group."}
