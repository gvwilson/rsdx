At the same time, they depend on the availability of sufficient amounts of Cu as an essential constituent of their respiratory protein, hemocyanin (Hc). It was, therefore, suggested that in snails Cu‐dependent MT and Hc pathways might be metabolically connected. In fact, the Cu‐specific snail MT (CuMT) is exclusively expressed in rhogocytes, a particular molluscan cell type present in the hemocoel and connective tissues. Snail rhogocytes are also the sites of Hc synthesis. In the present study, possible interactions between the metal‐regulatory and detoxifying activity of MTs and the Cu demand of Hc isoforms was explored in the edible snail Cornu aspersum , one of the most common European helicid land snails. This species possesses CdMT and CuMT isoforms involved in metal‐selective physiological tasks. In addition, C. aspersum expresses three different Hc isoforms (CaH ɑD, CaH ɑN, CaH β). We have examined the effect of Cd 2+ and Cu 2+ exposure on metal accumulation in the midgut gland and mantle of C. aspersum , testing the impact of these metals on transcriptional upregulation of CdMT , CuMT , and the three Hc genes in the two organs. We found that the CuMT and CaH ɑD genes exhibit an organ‐specific transcriptional upregulation in the midgut gland of Cu‐exposed snails. These results are discussed in view of possible interrelationships between the metal‐selective activity of snail MT isoforms and the synthesis and metabolism of Hc isoforms."}
