The aim of this study was to determine the perceptions of producers and harvesters of snails on climate change and habitat destruction, their effects on snails and the availability of the snail&#39;s feed. Questionnaires (402) were distributed in the Buea, Tiko, Muyuka, Kumba, Tombel, Ekondo Titi and Mamfe areas of Cameroon. Most respondents confirmed that they have heard about climate change (91.2%) and habitat destruction (87.3%). High proportions of 90.4 and 77.6% have noticed recent negative changes in the population of snails and their production respectively. Asked if these changes affect snail feeds as well, respondents said yes (53.5%) or partially (17.3%), explaining that it brings about a reduction in their feed mostly in the wild (showing a need for more domestication). Respondents (62.6%) also indicated that these changes expose the snails to pests, parasites and diseases, with 56.9% saying that these changes affect the performance and availability of snails. It can be deduced from the responses that climate change and environmental manipulations have an influence on the performance and availability of snails in captivity and in the wild, which necessitates conservation measures. &nbsp; Key words:&nbsp;Snails, climate change, environmental manipulations, feed, performance, South west region - Cameroon."}
