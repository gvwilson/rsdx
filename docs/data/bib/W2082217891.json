Blood was obtained from Arianta arbustorum, Cepaea hortensis and Helix pomatia collected in wet and dry weather, or kept dormant indoors. 2. Concentrations of sodium and magnesium were strongly correlated with each other and each to a lesser extent with total solute concentration; all tended to rise in dry conditions. 3. Concentrations of calcium in H. pomatia were lower in small specimens than large and rose during aestivation. 4. A method previously used for standardizing the ionic composition of the blood was shown to produce concentrations of sodium, magnesium and calcium like those found after heavy rain."}
