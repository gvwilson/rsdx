Dispersal of marked individuals averaged 83 cm per year within a stone pile and 291 cm in an area of exposed bedrock. Local population density of active C. clienta ranged from 5 to 794 individuals per m2. Shell characters were highly intercorrelated, both within and between populations. Principal component analysis revealed that most of the interpopulational variation could be expressed by the single character of shell height, which ranged from 5.54 to 6.94 mm. In all populations, snails of a given size had the same whorl number. Shell size was not influenced by habitat type (exposed rock surface, stone pile or stone wall) or proportion of calcareous stones within habitat. It was, however, negatively correlated with local population density, indicating intraspecific competition, and positively correlated with the degree of plant cover within the habitat. Analysis of variance revealed additionally a density effect of B. perversa on shell size in C. clienta, probably as a result of interspecific competition. Breeding experiments using C. clienta from different sites and carried out under unifrom conditions caused most of the phenotypic variation to disappear, demonstrating the high phenotypic plasticity of the species."}
