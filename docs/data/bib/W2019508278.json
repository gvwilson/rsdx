High levels of single-island endemism, the varying balance of families and genera between islands and the local differentiation of populations within islands all suggest that speciation has been predominantly a within island phenomenon. Restricted patterns of distribution, nevertheless, suggest that speciation is predominantly allopatric and that it is driven by repeated and sometimes devastating environmental changes. An equilibrium model of faunal diversity is rejected; the fauna is supersaturated at archipelago level, yet individual sites are not species rich, nor are all niches full. The consequences for the success and effects of invasions and introductions are discussed, and questions still to be answered raised, in particular about the timing of colonization events and their number, and about the great range of rates of radiation apparently achieved by different stocks."}
