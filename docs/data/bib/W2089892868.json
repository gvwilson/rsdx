Using in situ hybridization, we detected expression of its mRNA in the dendrite, cell body and axon of OSNs. By neural tracing, using the lipophilic tracer DiI and in situ hybridization, we have revealed the organization of OSNs and their connections with olfactory glomeruli in the land snail. Sequence and expression pattern analogy of land snail protein with olfactory marker protein (OMP) from vertebrates suggest that the land snail protein is an OMP-like protein. This protein could represent a plesiomorphic character in the evolution of olfactory proteins."}
