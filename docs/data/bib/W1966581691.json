The highest specific activities were found in the kidney followed by the digestive gland. Solubilised digestive gland alcohol oxidase had a pH optimum of approximately 7.2. The enzyme oxidises a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic (C 2 C 16 ) primary alcohols. Subcellular fractionation of digestive gland homogenate indicates that alcohol oxidase is most likely located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Cytosolic aldehyde oxidase was active with aromatic and aliphatic aldehyde but is not active with purines. A digestive role is suggested for these two enzymes. © Wiley‐Liss, Inc."}
