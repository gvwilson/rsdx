Therefore, the selection and evaluation of more sustainable ingredients for cosmetic preparations need greater attention. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the environmental impact of snail secretion filtrate (LX360®), which could be used as an alternative cosmetic ingredient. The Carbon Footprint (CF) was used to quantify the kgCO2eq per liter of the LX360® produced in a rearing system farm that follows circularity economy and regenerative agriculture principles. The study computes the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock change due to the implementation of regenerative agricultural practices. The CF of the production system was up to 1.76 kg CO2eq L−1, where the extraction stage contributed most. Findings on SOC stock showed a significant increase compared to the previous land-use. The net sequestered CO2 into the soil amounts to 2.07 kg CO2eq L−1; therefore, the production of LX360® showed a positive carbon balance (0.31 kg CO2eq L−1). The application of regenerative agriculture in snail rearing systems positively affects SOC sequestration, and it should be considered as a best management practice for the restoration of degraded land."}
