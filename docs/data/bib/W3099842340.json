Ecological factors were studied by measuring the population in moist and dry soil in the same village under all field conditions. Also, toxicological studies were conducted on these land snails under field conditions to know, the best compound which effective and cheaper in addition to avoid environmental pollution and harmful residues on plants, animal and human health. Tested compounds stated that superphosphate mixed with hyderated lime by percentage of 3:1 and foliar fertilizer improved plant growth and quality in addition to limiting individuals of these pests in relatively similar effect of some pesticides. Data showed high differences between moist and dry soil which recorded (64.6/34.8), (35.5/15.9), (35.8/18.0) and (38.5/17.4) respectively , also stated that high recorded individuals in moist soil of clover fields (64.8 per m2 at sharabass)."}
