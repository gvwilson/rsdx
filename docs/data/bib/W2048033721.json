The distribution of A. arbustorum is restricted, the species being largely confined to the bottoms of river valleys, especially in hedgerows. Variations in dampness seem the most likely limiting factor. C. hortensis is widespread and found in many habitats, but C. nemoralis is largely confined to woods, and is especially common in beechwoods. The morph-frequencies of C. nemoralis and C. hortensis vary in such a way as to suggest the operation of climatic and visual selection. In C. hortensis there are area effects for the presence or absence of pink five-banded shells, and there is an overall linkage disequilibrium resulting in an excess of unbandeds in non-yellow shells. Reasonable evidence for the operation of random factors in determining the morph-frequencies of populations of Cepaea in the area has been found only for three very disturbed populations. It is suggested that the large number of selective forces known to act on Cepaea populations in this area will account for the variation in morph-frequencies in populations from the same area or habitat."}
