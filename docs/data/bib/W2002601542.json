In our study we aimed at elucidating the question whether there is a correlation between shell colouration and immune defense in three land snail species by comparing phenoloxidase (PO) activity levels of different morphs after immunostimulation via Zymosan A-injection. Since phenoloxidase is involved both in immune defense as well as in melanin production, the PO activity level is particularly interesting when trying to resolve this question. Even though Zymosan A failed to induce PO activity rendering a comparison of inducible PO activity impossible, an interesting difference between pale and dark morphs of all tested species could be observed: dark snails were less affected by hemolymph withdrawal and were able to maintain or regenerate a significantly higher PO activity level after hemolymph withdrawal than pale snails. Possible implications of this observation are discussed."}
