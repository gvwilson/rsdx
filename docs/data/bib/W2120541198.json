Two out of three previously recognised species have recently been removed from this genus and placed in Setobaudinia Iredale, 1933 rendering the type species D. millepunctata (Smith, 1894) the only member of this genus. Based on the study of ethanol-preserved material from the type locality, Baudin Island, we revise the taxonomy of Damochlora, which is maintained as a distinct and monotypic genus. The examination of material from Cassini Island previously considered to be conspecific with D. millepunctata on account of possessing a nearly identical shell revealed that these snails represent a distinct species, for which the taxon name cassiniensis Smith, 1894 is available. This species is characterised by a profoundly different reproductive anatomy and therefore recognised as a distinct genus, for which the new name Nannochlora is being introduced.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:3189D63A-F183-4677-8EE6-293774EA8BA7"}
