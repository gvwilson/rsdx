In promiscuous species, the intensity of postulating sexual selection may be a function of population density. In this study we examined the variability of the distal genitalia involved in spcrmatophore production, reception and manipulation of 113 adult individuals of the simultaneously hermaphroditic land snail Arianta arbustorum (L.) from six natural populations in the Eastern Alps (Gesause, Austria). We investigated the hypothesis that these genitalia increase in relation to shell size with increasing population density (range: 0.9 to 39.8 individuals/m2) and expected a higher variance of the genitalia compared to shell dimensions due to sexual selection. Genitalic size was unexpectedly inversely related to population density, probably due to increased inhibitor)- effects of snail mucus. Patterns of variation of female and male characters did not differ. Coefficients of variation of the genitalia were significantly higher than those of the shell dimensions as predicted. This was due to a higher dispersion around the regression lines rather than higher allometric values. However, the influence of sexual selection on genitalic size and variance cannot be unambiguously determined. We discuss different scenarios emphasizing the importance of sexual selection to differing degrees and conclude that sexual selection has probably played only a minor role."}
