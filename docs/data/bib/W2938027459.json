To determine whether MFs are harmful for soil biota, we evaluated toxic effects on terrestrial snails (Achatina fulica) after 28 d exposure to polyethylene terephthalate MFs at concentrations of 0.01–0.71 g kg−1 (dry soil weight). Digestion kinetics experiments on 24 snails showed that MFs can be ingested and excreted within 48 h. We found the appearance of cracks and deterioration on the surface of MFs after depuration by the digestive system. Prolonged exposure to 40 snails showed that 0.14–0.71 g kg−1 MFs caused an average reduction of 24.7–34.9% food intake and 46.6–69.7% excretion. 0.71 g kg−1 MFs induced significant villi damage in the gastrointestinal walls of 40% snails, but did not influence the histology of the liver and kidney. Moreover, 0.71 g kg−1 MFs exposure reduced glutathione peroxidase (59.3 ± 13.8%) and total antioxidant capacity (36.7 ± 8.5%), but elevated malondialdehyde level (58.0 ± 6.4%) in the liver, which indicates oxidative stress is involved in the toxic mechanism. Our results suggest that MFs have adverse impacts on the fitness of soil organisms, and highlight the ecological risks of microplastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems."}
