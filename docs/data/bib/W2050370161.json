Using 14C-labeled bicarbonate, l -ornithine and l -citrulline, the South American land snail Strophocheilus oblongus was shown to be capable of arginine biosynthesis de novo. 2. 2. The relative rates of incorporation of bicarbonate-14C into arginine, aspartate and glutamate by hepatopancreas tissue in vitro indicates that the amount of arginine synthesized is nutritionally significant in this species. 3. 3. Three enzymes of the arginine pathway, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase, are present in most tissues of S. oblongus. 4. 4. The tissues also contain arginase activity and injected l -arginine-(guanidino-14C) is converted to urea-14C in vivo. 5. 5. A major portion of urea-14C injected into individual snails is released as carbon dioxide-14C and ureolytic activity was detected in hepatopancreas and also kidney. 6. 6. These findings are discussed relative to the ability of S. oblongus to acculate blood urea for osmotic water retention."}
