One population was analyzed for 1 year, to study the reproductive cycle and to assess the validity of three morphometric parameters as maturation diagnostic characters. The positive correlation between morphometric parameters (maximum diameter and number of whorls) can be useful to define the reproductive maturation status particularly during the active reproductive season. Oxychilus brincki is reproductively active between May and October/November; the residual values of mature oocytes between February and April allow reproduction to occur throughout the year. Our observations on gonadal maturation show that there is a functional protandric tendency and that photoperiod probably triggers the maturation process, whereas temperature acts mainly as a regulatory factor. Contrary to other terrestrial pulmonate snails that have a well demarcated reproductive cycle, Azorean species are gametogenically active throughout almost all the year.
