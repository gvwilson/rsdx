It was suggested recently that maturation of gametes may be initiated by annual temperature fluctuations and is perhaps correlated with changes in illumination. There does not seem to be much information on the influence of light. Induction of egg laying in the pulmonate pond snail Lymnaea palustris given light periods of 13.5 h or more has been reported and interruption of the dark period on a short day schedule is also effective2."}
