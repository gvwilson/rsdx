This is also the first record of a species of the eastern Asiatic genus Meghimatium on the American continents. The species was identified using morphological criteria and analysis of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I, COI. Our records indicate this species is widely distributed in southern and southeastern Brazil, in the States of São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, in disturbed and natural areas. We morphologically characterize M. pictum (external characteristics, reproductive system, jaw and radula) and provide some biological information based on field observations. We also discuss when M. pictum was probably introduced, from whence it came, possible pathways of introduction, and its characteristics as an invasive species and potential agricultural pest."}
