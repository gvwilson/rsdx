Fifteen minute exposures to a specific magnetic field both increased enkephalinase inhibitor induced opioid analgesia and induced analgesia in untreated snails. Injection of the prototypic opioid antagonist naloxone, attenuated, but did not completely block, the pulsed magnetic field induced analgesia. Two other pulsed waveform designs failed to induce analgesia in untreated snails. These findings suggest that specific magnetic field exposure designs may be tailored to produce significant behavioral effects including, but certainly not limited to, the induction of analgesia."}
