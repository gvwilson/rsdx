It has been shown that a specific mucus coating the love-dart is transferred into the partnerâ€™s blood and it suppresses subsequent matings in the darted individual in Euhadra quaesita. However, how the dart mucus suppresses subsequent matings is still unclear. In the present study, we tested a hypothesis for the underlying mechanisms: sperm donors reduce physical vigour in mating partners through injection of the dart mucus. In observational experiments, we found that neither locomotion behaviour nor food consumption differed between snails artificially injected with the mucus and snails injected with a control solution. These findings show that the dart mucus can suppress subsequent matings in the partners without affecting physical condition."}
