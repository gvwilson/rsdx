In the simultaneous hermaphrodite land snail Arianta arbustorum, sperm production precedes egg production by 2â€“4 weeks, resulting in a short period of protandric hermaphroditism before shell growth is completed. In natural populations, copulating pairs involving individuals which have not yet completed shell growth (virgins) have been observed. We ran a series of mate-choice experiments to examine whether virgin and nonvirgin (experienced) individuals of A. arbustorum discriminate between virgin and nonvirgin mating partners. We also assessed the number of sperm delivered to partners with different mating status. Neither virgin nor nonvirgin snails showed any preference for mating with a virgin partner. In all test situations mating was random and the number of sperm delivered was not adjusted to the mating status of the partner. Mating success was mainly determined by the activity of the individual. The random mating pattern does not imply random fertilization of eggs because the presence of a sperm-digesting organ and the morphology of the sperm storage organ allow a selective storage and use of sperm in A. arbustorum."}
