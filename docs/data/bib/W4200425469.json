{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.5817/mab2021-20-123", "year": 2021, "abstract": "The first findings of Cornu aspersum in the Lviv region are described, including the shell size and shell colouration variability. A review of the known records of C. aspersum in different regions of Ukraine, from the second half of the 19th century to the present day, is also presented. The most probable ways of penetration and the possibility of further acclimatization of this species in Western Ukraine are discussed. The chronology of the records of introduced species of land molluscs in Western Ukraine is described in tabular form, which, to a large extent, should reflect the chronology of their penetration into this area. It is noted that the majority of alien species began to be found in Western Ukraine only at the end of the 20th or the beginning of the 21st century. Simultaneously several species appeared here, previously known only for the south of the country."}
