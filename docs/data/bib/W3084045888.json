Also, measurements of three environmental variables were made; soil temperature, soil moisture and soil calcium content in adition to population density. Shell Aperture Index (Ia) and Shell Index (SI) for individuals from size class ranged between (9-12)mm were measured. The results showed that the deference in shell size by using (Ia) within population related to temperature, moisture and population density but, the value of Shell Index decreased in AL-Kadhimiya site (0.81-0.97) due to increase in population density. The species was characterized by shell colour variation (creamy white, white ,creamy). Also, The results showed strong and positive correlation between shell height and diameter and between shell aperture diameter and shell diameter for all size classes."}
