The complete mitochondrial genome of A. aubryana was first determined using long PCR reactions and primer walking method (accession number KT192071). The genome has a length of 14 238 bp, containing 37 typical mitochondrial genes (13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes and 2 rRNA genes). The base composition of the whole heavy strand is A 31.32%, T 37.86%, C 14.46% and G 16.36%. The results of phylogenetic analyses showed that the A. aubryana is most closely related to Mastigeulota kiangsinensis. This new complete mitochondrial genome can be the basic data for further studies on mitogenome comparison, molecular taxonomy and phylogenetic analyses in bradybaenid snails and Molluscs at large."}
