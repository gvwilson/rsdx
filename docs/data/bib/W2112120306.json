The initial swimming speed increased whereas the length of the infective period decreased with increasing temperature. The combined effect resulted in the E. caproni cercarial snail-finding capacity being temperature independent in the range 19 to 36 °C at a snail density of 0·014 snails/1. A moderate temperature dependency was, however, seen at a lower snail density. The cercarial snail-finding capacity was snail-host density dependent in the density range 0.014 to 1 snail/1. The findings from this study show that a relatively low and biologically realistic snail host density must be used in experimental studies if realistic estimates of the dynamics of cercarial transmission are to be obtained."}
