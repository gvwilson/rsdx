The new species is putatively classified into the genus Vulnus, which is only known so far from the Northern Maluku Islands. The genital anatomy, especially the presence of a well-developed penial sheath in V. wallacei, suggests a close relationship with Australian camaenids. However, the molecular phylogeny based on partial cytochrome c oxidase I, and 16S and 28S ribosomal RNA genes shows that the new species falls outside the cluster of all Australian Camaenidae.http://www.zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:D28554D0-3578-4E95-8849-09EAFB7D30F7"}
