Georgia is situated in the middle of this area, between the ranges of the Greater and Lesser Caucasus, a position providing exceptionally balanced environmental conditions for its flora and fauna. Animal groups of low mobility, such as land snails, are important indicators of the past and present geographic and climatic events shaping these unique ecosystems. We give an overview of the land snail family Clausiliidae in Georgia that includes 30 species, among which eight are endemic to this country. Their distribution areas are reassessed in the light of novel georeferenced occurrence data resulting from recent field work. Aspects of the origin, diversity, habitat requirements and conservation status of the Georgian Clausiliidae fauna are discussed. Additionally, Mucronaria (Mucronaria) kartvelica sp. n. is described from the Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti Region."}
