Somatic cells of this species had 2n = 58. Karyotypes were also analysed with 16 metacentric, 12 submetacentric and one subtelocentric chromosome pairs. Observed chromosomes ranged from 2.6 to 8.9 μm and the total length was 122.3 μm. This is the second report on the chromosome numbers and the karyotype of K. koreana."}
