These services tend to emphasize ties with old homeland cultures, raising questions as to whether they assist emigrants in developing a sense of belonging in their new homelands. Research suggests that program services relayed by satellite from the old homelands are especially valued by older emigrants, but also that they have some impact on younger emigrants. There is a range of new homeland services for emigrants, but prospects for future growth seem low, especially for services aimed at younger viewers, and there is a shortage of programming which emphasizes the creation of bridges between cultures. Audience research often ignores the qualitative dimension of emigrant audience's reaction to old and new homeland media services and programs produced for them, and two potential studies are proposed as examples of the sorts of issues researchers might investigate."}
