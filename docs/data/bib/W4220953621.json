Two different life stages of a cosmopolitan terrestrial gastropod Helix aspersa aspersa (syn. Cantareus aspersus or Cornu aspersum) were used. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cadmium on a target organism (H. aspersa aspersa) and the possible transfer of cadmium to the snail tissues. The sensitivity of different snailsâ€™ life stages exposed to different levels of cadmium was evaluated. The ecotoxicity tests for juvenile snails were performed according to ISO 15952:2018 standard and lasted for 28 days. During that period, the growth inhibition (both in mass and shell diameter) was observed. The embryotoxicity experiments lasted for 14 days and the hatching success was evaluated. The IC50 (inhibition concentration) values for juveniles and eggs were calculated as 68.2 and 7.6 mg/L of Cd2+, respectively. All individuals were frozen for the determination of cadmium content by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The results proved the increased levels of cadmium in the tissues while the mass of the snails decreased. Our results confirm that snail H. aspersa aspersa (and its life stages) is a very suitable laboratory organism for soil ecotoxicity assessment."}
