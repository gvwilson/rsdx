The mean size of aggregations was 25 cm × 25 cm but varied, according to the area a grass tuft covered, while the intensity of aggregations was influenced by weather conditions. Densities of 10–15 subadults and 3–6 adults m −2 were found along ditches and streams, 2–25 subadults and 2–20 adults on uncultivated alpine meadows, while on scree‐covered alpine grassland the density of subadults and adults was 0.3–0.5 m −2 . The extent of daily movements varied with microclimatic factors and season and depended on the structure of the habitat. The dispersal rate was greatest in June (2.6 m month −1 ) and least in August (1.1 m month −1 ). In summer and autumn, active uphill movements were noted, a process which compensates for the loss of altitude by passive downhill displacements. Roiling down on snowfields and being carried away by avalanches and streams were observed."}
