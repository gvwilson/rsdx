The results indicated that LC50 values of methomyl were almost equal LC50 values of abamectin indicating more molluscicidal potency of abamectin and methomyl. Results also revealed a complete consistency of correlation between the LC50 values and exposed time intervals. The high molluscicidal activity of abamectin against E. vermiculata and T. pisana compared to methomyl using topical application technique could be used practically in the field of land snails control program and overcome some drawbacks of using bait forms in this respect. Comparing the LD50 values indicate the significant variation of the molluscicidal activity between the two applications methods used in addition to the variation between the two species of chosen snails, the brown garden snail E. vermiculata were resistant species than the white garden snail T. pisana."}
