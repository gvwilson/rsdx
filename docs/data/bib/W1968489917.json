{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1968.tb00981.x", "year": 1968, "abstract": "(i) \r\nThe experiment described in this paper was designed to investigate Sheppard's (1951) results which showed that thrushes predated individuals of G. nemoralis selectively, and further that the relative disadvantage of the yellow morph changed with the changing colour of the background.\r\n\r\n(ii) \r\nBecause of the scarcity of thrushes only a relatively few individuals were predated. The predation was much later in the year than in Sheppard's experiment, probably because of the differences in weather conditions.\r\n\r\n(iii) \r\nThe results of the experiment indicate that yellows are at a disadvantage during the summer months in the area under investigation, probably because there is a dense and tall growth of herbs in the area and this gives rise to a dark background near the ground.\r\n\r\n(iv) \r\nThese results are similar to those obtained by Wolda (1963) who could not explain them in terms of the colour of the background. It seems likely that the present explanation could account for his results.\r\n\r\n(v) \r\nA comparison of the yellow morph-frequencies of predated samples removed from the area before the present experiment was begun, with those in the predated sample from the original natural population found by Sheppard 12 years previously show very little difference although the addition of Sheppard's experimental population changed the frequency of this morph considerably. It is therefore suggested that systematic processes play a large part in determining the population genetic structure."}
