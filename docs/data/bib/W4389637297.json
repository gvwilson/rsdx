Sauroconcha is evidently related to Meridolum, which is widely distributed in eastern New South Wales and south eastern Queensland, and to Glyptorhagada of South Australia but distinguished from both on shell and reproductive characters. The relationships and conservation status of Sauroconcha are discussed."}
