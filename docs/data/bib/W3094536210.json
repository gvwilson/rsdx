In order to resolve the taxonomy of this group, a phylogenetic reconstruction of Sarika is presented, based on morphological and anatomical characters, as well as on partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. In total, 23 species of Sarika are recognised in Thailand, and nine species are new to science, namely S. caligina Pholyotha &amp;amp; Panha, sp. nov. , S. gratesi Pholyotha &amp;amp; Panha, sp. nov. , S. inferospira Pholyotha &amp;amp; Panha, sp. nov. , S. lactospira Pholyotha &amp;amp; Panha, sp. nov. , S. megalogyne Pholyotha &amp;amp; Panha, sp. nov. , S. melanospira Pholyotha &amp;amp; Panha, sp. nov. , S. pellosa Pholyotha &amp;amp; Panha, sp. nov. , S. solemi Pholyotha &amp;amp; Panha, sp. nov. , and S. subheptagyra Pholyotha &amp;amp; Panha, sp. nov. Results from genital examination and COI analyses confirm the monophyly of Sarika and its species. The intra- and inter-specific genetic distances of Sarika were 0–3.7% and 4.6–12.0%, respectively. Colour images of the living adults, shell, and genitalia along with SEM images of the spermatophore and radula are given. In addition, an identification key and a geographical distribution map of Sarika species are provided."}
