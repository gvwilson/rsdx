In this paper we present the first record of the Desmoulin's whorl snail in this area, and report the site conditions and the structure of accompanying land snail community. The site was examined by visual searching, including a 6-litre sample of plant litter collected and subsequently analysed. A numerous viable population of the species was recorded only by visual searching, whereas the litter sample did not yield any shells of the Desmoulin's whorl snail."}
