Fourteen species and subspecies of Aegista are known from South Korea. They were described, based only on shell morphology during 1887â€“1943 and our knowledge on diversity of Korean Aegista has seldom been updated since then. In this study, we provide the report on the first molecular investigation of diversity of Aegista in South Korea, which unmasked some of overlooked diversity of this group."}
