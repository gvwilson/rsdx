A total of 86 individual nodes and one generalized node were identified for the continental gastropods. Most grid cells showed low diversity values, except for 3 cells with diversity values greater than 10%, which can be considered hotspots. On the other hand, despite the different environments, land and freshwater snails showed similar historical and spatial distribution patterns."}
