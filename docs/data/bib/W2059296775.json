Ornithine transcarbamylase and argininosuccinate-splitting enzyme activity have been detected in this species for the first time in an invertebrate animal. Although the snail ornithine transcarbamylase was shown to require carbamyl phosphate for activity, the synthesis of this compound could not be demonstrated in vitro. Citrulline metabolism by extracts of the hepatopancreas was found to have similar requirements to the argininosuccinate synthetase system of vertebrates, and suggestive evidence for the presence of this or a very similar enzyme system in the snail was obtained. Studies on the arginase activity of the hepatopancreas showed that estivation did not significantly affect the tissue arginase levels in this species. A small amount of urease activity was also demonstrated in extracts of the hepatopancreas."}
