To address this issue, samples of snails were taken throughout the distribution range of the two taxa in the Dahomey Gap (West Africa) and separated into 112 A. achatina and 141 A. togoensis according to color of the columella and parietal wall. Radulae were compared and shell characters of these 2 species were evaluated through the traditional morphometric method. The results indicate that the species cannot be distinguished by overall shell size and radular morphology, but they exhibit significant differences in shell shape and meristic traits. The typical A. achatina with vinaceous-red columella has a low-spired shell and an expanded aperture (globose shape) whereas A. togoensis has a higher-spired and smaller aperture (a fusiform shape). We suggest that local environmental effects are probably the causes of morphological divergence between the two taxa. It is likely that peripheral populations of the typical form of A. achatina would have isolated and developed in the drier facies of the humid forest that individualized in the northern sector of the mountains after the arid or interpluvial period of Holocene. In addition, we find that A. togoensis meets the criteria B2ab (ii, iii) to categorize as “Endangered”. However, whether this latter should be considered as separate species cannot be decided at the current state of knowledge."}
