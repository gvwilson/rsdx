In total, 38 species, constituting half of all terrestrial snail species recorded in Latvia, were found. The examined alder swamps can be divided into 2 groups and 4 subgroups, each having its own indicator species and different species frequency in snail communities. Only seven species – Carychium minimum, Cochlicopa lubrica, Euconulus fulvus, Punctum pygmaeum, Succinea putris, Vertigo substriata and Zonitoides nitidus – are characteristic species of forest snail communities in all clusters. Acicula polita, Bulgarica cana, Clausilia bidentata, C. dubia, C. cruciata, C. pumila and Ruthenica filograna are endangered and protected in Latvia. Vertigo moulinsiana is the only species included in Annex II of the EU Habitats and Species Directive."}
