Results revealed that several variations in composition were observed between all species. Oxime, methoxy-phenyl and cyclotrisiloxane, hexamethyl were major components found that in three species, the total areas detected were 86.23, 76.83 and 70.83, respectively. This different composition of mucus may be due to differences from one species to another; different mechanical properties (function) are influenced by external factors such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil conditions and food supply."}
