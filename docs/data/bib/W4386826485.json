Although previous studies have looked at individual components of mucus , especially their proteins, little is known about the overall composition of various mucuses and how it affects function. “It’s remarkable how little we know about this material that’s ubiquitous and central to life,” says Adam B. Braunschweig of the Advanced Science Research Center at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Braunschweig and coworkers have now done a comparative analysis of three types of mucus produced by the common garden snail Cornu aspersum ( Nat. Commun. 2023, DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-41094-z ). An adhesive mucus secreted by the snail’s foot helps the animal stick to surfaces. A lubricating mucus, also produced by the foot, helps the snail glide along surfaces. A third mucus on the snail’s back protects the animal from predators. The researchers analyzed multiple components from each"}
