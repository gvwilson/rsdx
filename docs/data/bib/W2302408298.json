The probability of arousal is directly related to ambient relative humidity. Arousal from dormancy is less likely to occur at high ambient temperatures than at low ones. The temperature range within which arousal occurs is related to the ambient relative humidity. The range is narrow at low relative humidities and wide at high humidities. Repeated arousals do not take place following a return to the dormant condition, even in the presence of favorable environmental conditions. The absence of light favors arousal; exposure to continuous light acts as a deterrent to emergence from dormancy."}
