Therefore, we compared in the laboratory the trade-offs in reproductive traits between early (after maturity) and delayed (after dormancy) reproduction in young land snails Cornu aspersum (MÃ¼ller, 1774) (syn. Helix aspersa ), depending on food energy content. We also investigated the maternal investment in reproductive output in both breeding periods. After attaining maturity, snails produced single clutches with many small eggs, which resulted, in contrast to previous studies, in large offspring with a low hatching rate owing to high within-clutch cannibalism. The young cannibals may have a higher survival probability in the following hibernation. Snails starting to reproduce after hibernation had smaller clutches of larger eggs, resulting in high quantity of lighter offspring. The clutch mass was positively correlated with maternal mass in snails reproducing after having attained maturity and negatively correlated in snails reproducing after hibernation. Multiple oviposition occurred only after hibernation, thereby enhancing reproductive success. An energy-rich diet did not affect reproductive strategies. Further studies should focus on seasonal plasticity of reproductive strategies in natural populations of C. aspersum and investigate survival probabilities of breeders and juveniles in an evolutionary context."}
