These species, Archachatina marginata and Achatina fulica, form an important source of protein in Cameroon, but widespread utilization may possibly impact natural patterns of genetic diversity of the indigenous species, while the introduced species may display signs of genetic drift. The evolutionary relationship between the indigenous and introduced species was also studied. Specimens were collected from seven sites in Cameroon. Genetic analyses using COI mitochondrial DNA data suggest that gene flow among the Ar. marginata populations screened follows a model of isolation by distance, and genetic diversity estimates for this species did not provide support for the hypothesis of loss of genetic diversity in areas of intense harvesting. Diversity in the introduced species was much lower, which is likely the signature of an introduction involving limited numbers."}
