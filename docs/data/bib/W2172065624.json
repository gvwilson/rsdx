In the present study, the effects of availability of moisture and its interaction with live weight of dormant C. fasciola were examined in the laboratory for effects on the length of time that snails required to resume activity. Snail live weight increased with availability of water during transition of dormancy to activity. The amount of water uptake required to break dormancy, proportional to snail live weight, was less for larger snails than for smaller snails. The duration of dormancy breaking was much longer at a water temperature of 5 °C than at 10–30 °C. These results are discussed in relation to prospects for control of C. fasciola in crops by manipulating dormancy."}
