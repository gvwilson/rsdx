A demographic study revealed that (a) 3 cohorts exist at any time during the year (when adults of all generations belong to the same cohort) (b) egg-laying and hatching occur during the months of July and August respectively, (c) the most rapid growth takes place during spring. Study of H. lucorum genitalia in relation to age showed that the snails axe sexually mature 3 years after hatching, when the largest diameter of their shell (D) is equal to or greater than 35 mm Von Bertallanffy's method suggests that Helix lucorum may live up to 14 years or more in order to reach its possible maximum size (48.80 mm) The study of relative growth of D in relation to Ps (peristome surface) of Helix lucorum shows that D grows faster than Ps when D≤12.50 mm; juveniles change their growth rate when their D arrives at 22.05 mm, and growth becomes slower when adults arrive at 36.27 mm Annual secondary production calculated by the size frequency method gave a mean annual density of 3.39 individuals per m2, a mean annual crop (biomass) of 4.04 g-m−2 and an annual production (P) of 5.02 g · m−2. The annual turnover ratio (P//b) is equal to 1.24"}
