The present study aims to assess the biological responses triggered by iron oxide NPs (IONPs) and iron oxide NPs incorporated into zeolite (IONPZ) in relation to oxidative stress on the land snail Helix aspersa in order to investigate its use as a biomarker for terrestrial environments. Morphology and structure of both NPs were characterized. Snail food was supplemented with a range of concentrations of IONPs and IONPZ and values of the hemocyte lysosomal membranes' destabilization by 50% were estimated by the neutral red retention (NRRT50) assay. Subsequently, snails were fed with NPs concentrations equal to half of the NRRT50 values, 0.05 mg L−1 for IONPs and 1 mg L−1 for IONPZ, for 1, 5, 10 and 20 days. Both effectors induced oxidative stress in snails' hemocytes compared to untreated animals. The latter was detected by NRRT changes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lipid peroxidation estimation, DNA integrity loss, measurement of protein carbonyl content by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), determination of ubiquitin conjugates and cleaved caspases conjugates levels. The results showed that the simultaneous use of the parameters tested could constitute possible reliable biomarkers for the evaluation of NPs toxicity. However, more research is required in order to enlighten the disposal and toxic impact of iron oxide NPs on the environment to ensure their safe use in the future."}
