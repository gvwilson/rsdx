It was first recorded from Rensselaer County in the state of New York in 2015 by a community scientist. From 2016 to 2020, 14 additional occurrences in Rensselaer County, neighbouring Albany County and an imprecisely localized site in the Adirondack Mountains were recorded by community scientists. In 2020, the species was newly recorded at two sites in Schoharie County, NY, and at three sites in Qu√©bec, one of them approximately 700 km to the north of the initial record. Partial mitochondrial cox1 sequences from Rensselaer differ from an eastern Ukrainian haplotype only in a single substitution. Therefore, a Ukrainian origin for this introduction is likely, although not certain: the Rensselaer haplotype also differs in only two substitutions from a more widespread haplotype known from Ukraine, Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia, Serbia, and Bulgaria. An environmental niche model of the species based on occurrence data from central and eastern Europe indicated that a large region from the northern east coast to the midwestern United States is suitable for C. vindobonensis . The Canadian occurrences may indicate that the North American lineage is able to survive colder winters than predicted by the environmental niche model. Caucasotachea vindobonensis is not listed as a pest in Europe and it is unlikely to become an agricultural pest in North America as it prefers rotting plant material over living parts of plants, but its impact on native organisms can hardly be predicted."}
