{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1111/bij.12418", "year": 2015, "abstract": "We investigated the land snail fauna of Nyungwe Forest National Park in south-western Rwanda. Fifty plots at altitudes between 1718 and 2573 m were studied. In total, 3461 specimens were collected and were assigned to 102 land snail species. With respect to land snail species, Nyungwe Forest is the richest forest known in Africa. A comparison with other forests in the northern Albertine Rift indicates that land snail species richness in this region is significantly correlated with distance from Pleistocene forest refugia. The high beta diversity in Nyungwe is the result of a high species turnover between sites, which has biogeographical and ecological origins. Nyungwe Forest is situated on the Congoâ€“Nile divide where species of different geographical origin may meet. Moreover, Nyungwe Forest offers a high diversity of habitats because it extends across a wide range of altitudinal zones. Species richness decreased with increasing altitude. It was also correlated with the presence of bare rocks that offer additional microhabitats and shelter. Although the occurrences of different land snail species in Nyungwe Forest were significantly clustered, only a minority of the species could be assigned to a group of species with similar occurrences. The majority of the species respond individualistically to environmental variables. The significant nestedness of the occurrences of the land snail species in Nyungwe was mainly correlated with altitude."}
