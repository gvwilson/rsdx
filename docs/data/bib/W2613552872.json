Analyses determined the percentages of proteins, lipids, sugars, the composition of water and mineral elements, also antioxidant capacity. H. aspersa maxima eggs contain the high percentage of protein and are low in lipids (cholesterol content average 0.69 mg%), and are also found rich in Ca. The results showed that the eggs possess antioxidant activity and do not lose the antioxidants during short term storage in salt solution. The results make it possible to evaluate nutritional quality of eggs land snails as a good food source."}
