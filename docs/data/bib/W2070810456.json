{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/44.3.400", "year": 1995, "abstract": "Although entirely surrounded by estuarine waters, the sea islands of South Carolina are of dubious biogeographic integrity. Pleistocene sea level fluctuations have periodically inun? dated these regions and left them de-watered inland. Samples from 10 populations of the fresh? water pulmonate snail, Physa heterostropha, inhabiting six land masses isolated by putative estua? rine barriers in the Charleston area were used for allozyme electrophoresis to estimate gene frequencies at 10 polymorphic loci. Although intrapopulation and interpopulation gene diversity- was extensive, none of the variance could be attributed to island or land mass by hierarchical analysis of F statistics. The matrix of genetic distances among all sites was significantly correlated with the matrix of linear geographic distances, even though estuaries dissect the study area. Nearest neighbors separated by estuaries tended to be more similar genetically than nearest neigh? bors sharing a land mass. These data on the population genetics of freshwater snails seem to hold no evidence of biogeographic boundaries among sea islands. Dispersal by birds is a plausible explanation for the observed overall correlation between genetic and geographic distance, but vicariance or natural selection hypotheses cannot be excluded.
