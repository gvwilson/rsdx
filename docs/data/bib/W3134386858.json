Results revealed that famine and dryness affect on the weight and mortality of all stages of this snail particularly three months stage, while adults were the most support to these factors. Data indicated also that this treatments were more impressive on the number of clutches, the number of eggs in each clutch, depth of clutch in the soil and solitary eggs deposited. The snail laid the most number of the eggs when it fed every 2 days under 80-85% soil moisture. On the other hand, adults of this snail were compelled to lay their eggs on surface of the soil under dryness conditions."}
