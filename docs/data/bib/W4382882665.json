Snails were exposed to serial concentrations of the clodinafop-propargyl for successive seven days using contact and bait techniques. The Median Lethal concentration (LC50) was determined and the effect of LC25 of test compound was examined on the total protein and alkaline phosphatase after seven days of treatment. In the field, the effect of the test compound used poison bait was evaluated after 21 days against H. aspersa on mango nursery trees at a reclaimed land in Abu- Rwash, Giza Governorate, Egypt. The effect of clodinafop –propargyl (25.200 ppm) was compared with methomyl (4.000 ppm) a compound recommended by Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation in the field trials. The effects were evaluated after 1, 3,7, 15, and 21 days of treatment with both compounds. Based on the laboratory data for clodinafop –propargyl the LC50 were 6.750 ppm for the contact and 8.250 ppm for the bait method after seven days of treatment. Moreover, the compound caused a reduction in the total protein and alkaline phosphatase compared with the control. In the field, the compound caused 90.7% reduction in snail population compared to 75.0% reduction caused by methomyl after 21 days of treatment. Therefore, it be concluded that clodinafop –propargyl compound can be used as poison bait in the control programs to combat land snails"}
