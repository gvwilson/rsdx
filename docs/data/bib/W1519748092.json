Morphometric and 16S mitochondrial DNA data for some 220 individuals reveal strong morphological differentiation, despite ongoing unidirectional gene flow from the epigean into the hypogean environment, strong, small-scale genetic structuring within the cave and underground dispersal between caves that were previously thought to be isolated. We discuss these results – which constitute the first phylogeographical analysis of a terrestrial cave snail – in the light of speciation in cave organisms and across ecotones in general."}
