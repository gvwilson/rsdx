Although complex genetic patterns have been described for mainland species affected by glacial cycles of isolation, island biotas have received little attention. We examined mitochondrial DNA in Amplirhagada land snails from 16 islands and two adjacent mainland areas of the Bonaparte Archipelago, in the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia. Four major clades, with sequence divergence of 16–27% in the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, correspond to the major geographic groupings, separated by 10–160 km. Distinct lineages also characterize islands that are only a few kilometres apart. The large differences indicate that the lineages are much older than the islands themselves, and show no evidence of geologically recent connection. Three of the major clades match the morphological description of Amplirhagada alta. Either this named species comprises several morphologically cryptic species, or it is a single, genetically very diverse species, distributed over much of the Bonaparte Archipelago."}
