The mean activity patterns in three light-dark (LD) cycles (LD 14: 10, LD12: 12, LD 10: 14) were characterized by bimodal peaks, namely an initial major peak 1-2 hr after the onset of darkness and a later peak after nearly 6 hr. The activity rhythms were able to follow a 6 hr phase advance shift of the LD 14: 10 cycle with transients, accompanied by shortening or splitting of the activity time. When splitting occurred, the initial component showed phase advancement in the dark and phased to lights-off whereas the later one phased to lights-on, with post-dawn activity being suppressed by light. These results suggest the presence of multioscillator circadian organization which shows monophasic or biphasic entrainment under the LD cycles."}
