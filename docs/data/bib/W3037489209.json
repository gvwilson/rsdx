Juveniles of V. moulinsiana, for example, tend to remain within the shaded, humid and cool layer of the litter, while adults usually climb above wet vegetation to a height of over 2 m. Adults are thus exposed to greater variation in temperature and humidity than juveniles. My experiments showed that adults of V. moulinsiana remain active longer than juveniles when subject to high temperature (36 °C) and low relative humidity (RH 30%). Conversely, juveniles stay active longer than adults in high humidity (22 °C, RH 100%). A short period of starvation lengthened the time needed for the juveniles to become active after dormancy, possibly indicating a different response between adults and juveniles to lack of nutritional reserves. These behavioural differences to food availability and the risk of water loss correspond to the microhabitat differences observed between adults and juveniles in the wild."}
