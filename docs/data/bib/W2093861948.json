{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01688170.1988.10510378", "year": 1988, "abstract": "Summary To evaluate the influence of repeated mating on female fecundity in the simultaneously hermaphroditic, self-incompatible land snail Arianta arbus-torum, the number and size of clutches, egg size and hatching success of individuals from 3 populations were determined under conditions of isolation and grouping during one breeding season in a field cage experiment. Only adult snails which had mated and oviposited in the preceding year were used. Sperm storage enabled isolated individuals to continue with the production of fertilized eggs. Snails kept singly or in groups differed neither in number of clutches laid nor in egg size. But isolated snails laid smaller clutches than did grouped snails. As a result isolated snails produced fewer eggs per breeding season. Hatching success varied greatly between populations and rearing conditions. In general, isolated snails had fewer hatchlings than grouped snails, indicating that individuals prevented from remating suffered a reduced fitness."}
