The entire circular genome is 14,795â€‰bp in size and represents the first mitochondrial genome in the genus Theba, with two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 13 protein coding genes. All of genes are divided into two groups, including 24 genes on the majority coding strand (J strand) and others on the minority coding strand (N strand).The phylogeny supports the relationship of species in Helicidae."}
