Modern and ancient δ13C values ranged from −9.2‰ to −7.7‰ and from −13.6‰ to −5.7‰, respectively, and they differed among taxa. δ13C values were similar for Neolithic (δ13C = −8.1 ± 2.3‰), Copper Age (δ13C = −8.4 ± 0.6‰) and modern (δ13C = −8.4 ± 0.5‰) herbivorous Cernuella specimens. Alternatively, fossil shells of the herbivorous Ferussacia folliculum (δ13C = −9.9 ± 1.2‰) and the omnivorous Rumina decollata (δ13C = −11 ± 1.2‰) showed substantially lower δ13C values than modern specimens, which may suggest lower water stress during the early to mid Holocene than today. The δ18O values from modern specimens ranged from −1.1‰ to +0.6‰ while the δ18O values from fossil specimens ranged from −6.7‰ to +0‰ and they differed among species. Cernuella exhibited shell δ18O values that increased from the Neolithic (δ18O = −2.3 ± 1.8‰) and Copper Age (δ18O = −1.7 ± 0.6‰) to the present (δ18O = −0.3 ± 0.5‰). The δ18O values of fossil shells of F. folliculum (δ18O = −3.7 ± 1.0‰) and R. decollata (δ18O = −4.0 ± 1.6‰) were also lower than modern shells. Calculations of a published snail-flux balance mixing model for δ18O values indicate that early to mid Holocene shells precipitated during times when relative humidity was greater than today. The SE Iberian Peninsula was noticeably wetter ∼7200 cal BP, and experienced drier conditions thereafter. The results are consistent with other regional paleoclimatic proxies and reinforce the potential use of land snail shells as paleoenvironmental archives."}
