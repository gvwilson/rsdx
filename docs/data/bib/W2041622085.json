The distal reproductive anatomy, head wart, jaw and radula of the type species, Meliobba shafferyi Iredale, 1940, are described, providing a wider set of characters on which the generic diagnosis may be based. Anatomical characters of this species are compared with that of Rhynchotrochus macgillivrayi (Forbes, 1852) and similarities between the reproductive tracts of the two taxa indicate that they may be closely related. The head wart, which is present in many carnaenid genera, is identified as a useful character for determining phylogenetic relationships. It is suggested that the papuinine snails may not form a monophyletic group but may represent multiple convergences of shell shape and ecology."}
