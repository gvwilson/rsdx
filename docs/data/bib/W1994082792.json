The most potent inhibitors against NTE of H. aspersa snail were O‐methyl O‐2,5‐dichlorophenyl phenylphosphonate and dimethoate‐oxon with Ki values of 6.01 x 105 and 5.94 x 105 M‐1 min‐1, respectively. In the case of T. pisana, triphenyl phosphite and O‐methyl O‐2,5‐dichlorophenyl phenyl‐phosphonate showed high potency as NTE inhibitors with Ki values of 1.74 x 107 and 4.14 x 106 M‐1 min‐1, respectively. From the results obtained, NTE free of inhibitor had the highest dissociation constant in both snails, where Km value of H. aspersa snail was 180 times smaller than Km value of T. pisana. The lowest Km value of H. aspersa snail was found to be 1.6 x 10‐3 M for EPN‐oxon while the highest value was 1.2 x 10‐2 m for leptophos‐oxon. On the other hand, the lowest Km value of T. pisana snail did account for 2.4 x 10‐3 for dimethoateoxon. Finally it could be concluded that ENP‐oxon had the highest affinity to NTE of H. aspersa snail whereas leptophos‐oxon had the highest affinity to NTE of T. pisana snail."}
