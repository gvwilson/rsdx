This work is the first report of such changes in the land snail Cepaea hortensis (Mull). Collections of C. hortensis were made at Silbury Hill, Wiltshire in 1957, 1963 and 1978. The banded phenotype significantly declined in frequency between 1963 and 1978. It is argued that the decline, which was statistically homogeneous at 15 separate sites within the area, was a consequence of natural selection. The average selection coefficient against the banded homozygote is estimated to have been greater than 1096."}
