{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/09397140.2003.10637957", "year": 2003, "abstract": "Abstract We compared the shells and genitalia of the land snail Jaminia from 24 locations on mainland Turkey and two Aegean islands. No consistent differences were noted between the genitalia of the coastal and inland specimens. However, most coastal shells were smaller than inland shells. Additionally, in most coastal shells the subcolumellar apertural tooth was located at the edge of the lip, whereas in most inland shells it was below the edge of the lip. Based on these conchological differences between the coastal and inland populations, we currently retain the subspecies J. loewii loewii from inland areas and J. loewii godetiana from coastal areas."}
