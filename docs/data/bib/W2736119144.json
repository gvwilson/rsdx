A. alpinus occurs in forest ecosystems in the southern part of the Czech Republic at the margin of its continuous distribution range. Both externally and anatomically the Czech Republican specimens strongly resemble A. alpinus from neighbouring countries. Identification was confirmed by DNA analysis."}
