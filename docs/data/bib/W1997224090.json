The land snail Helix can overcome injections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at doses 30d. Doses of <107 g−1 are not protective. Heat-killed bacteria allow snails to prolong survival after 108 vc g−1, but not to overcome that dose. Of various immunogens tried, P. aeruginosa provided the only effective vaccine."}
