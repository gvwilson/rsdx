Currently, approximately 19 species are considered valid. However, for most of them, the internal morphology is unknown. Leiostracusobliquus was described as a species of Bulimus from the state of Bahia based on shell characters. Until now, knowledge of this species has been scarce. The discovery of ethanol-preserved specimens from MZSP of this species allowed us to characterize, for the first time, the internal anatomy of this species and update its distribution. The shell of L.obliquus has seven to eight whorls and a wide pale-pink disrupted band all over the teleoconch. The rachidian tooth is small rectangular, symmetric, with round edges, and without differentiated cusps. After comparing the anatomy and radular characters between the shells of L.obliquus and L.carnavalescus, we found remarkable similarities in the morphology and color pattern."}
