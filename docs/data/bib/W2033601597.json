The biology of Paryphanta busbyi watti , an endangered carnivorous land snail, was studied mostly by following large juvenile and adult snails with harmonic radar. The snails are nocturnally active and most (79%) hide during the day under leaf litter or in dense vegetation. Fecal analysis showed that the diet is primarily earthworms, but some cannibalism of smaller snails occurs. Empty shells appear to be an additional source of dietary calcium. Mating occurred most frequently between April and July. Mating snails stayed together for 4–7 days, and each pair reversed their positions at least twice. Four snails were first found mating 151–1240 d after they acquired adult shells, and 7 snails were observed mating a second time after 66–298 d. We found 8 nests and observed 6 snails ovipositing; 5 snails laid eggs in holes they dug and one laid eggs in a crevice between rocks. In 2 instances, oviposition was recorded 52 and 140 d after mating. Snails were estimated to lay on average ∼17.5 eggs per year in 3–5 clutches. Most oviposition was observed in August/September, but some occurred between November and February. Of the snails that died, pigs killed 13.6% and humans inadvertently killed another 13.6%. Other snails died from unknown causes mostly during the drier and warmer months, from November to April. This large land snail survives in the presence of introduced predators, but some life history traits could predispose it to a rapid decline in numbers if new predators arrive."}
