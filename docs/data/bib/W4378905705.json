A recent study performed in the freshwater snail Heleobia atacamensis, endemic to the Atacama Saltpan, revealed a strong interdependence of genetic patterns with climatic fluctuations and landscape physiography. The species is currently listed as Critically Endangered at regional scale and as Data Deficient on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Here, we studied genetic diversity and demographic history of several populations of the species occurring on a connectivity gradient, including snails from new peripherical localities (Peine and Tilomonte), which were compared with topotype specimens. In addition, we reassessed the conservation status using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria considering species-specific idiosyncrasy. Phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses indicated that snails from Peine and Tilomonte belong to H. atacamensis. We discovered significant differentiation in shell morphology, which was generally greater in geographically isolated populations. We also inferred six genetic clusters and a demographic expansion congruent with the wet periods that occurred at the end of the Pleistocene. Considering the highest risk category obtained, H. atacamensis was reassessed as Endangered at regional scale. Future conservation plans should consider the genetic assemblages as conservation units."}
