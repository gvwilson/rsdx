Herein a report on the land snail diversity based on specimens collected recently from karstic and non-karstic areas in southern Cambodia is provided. This checklist presents 36 species of land snails (two Neritimorpha, six Caenogastropoda, and 28 Heterobranchia). Illustrations and brief taxonomic notes/remarks are provided for every species. We also described Georrisa carinata Sutcharit &amp;amp; Jirapatrasilp, sp. nov. based on some distinct shell morphological characters. Since the first descriptions during the colonial period in the nineteenth century, some land snail species (e.g., Trichochloritis norodomiana , Durgella russeola , Anceyoconcha siamensis obesula comb. nov. , Anceyoconcha chaudoensis comb. nov ., and Succinea tenuis ) have not been reported subsequently. This probably reflects a lack of knowledge concerning land snail biodiversity in this country. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey of land snails in southern Cambodia. A need for more field research and systematic revision of the land snails in this interesting region is also highlighted and demonstrated."}
