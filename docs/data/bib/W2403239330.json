The level of heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Cd) were determined using Atomic absorption Spectrophotometer. Analysis of the results showed that the concentration of lead ranged from 4.15 mg/kg in Omida market to 7.93mg/kg in Lafenwa market. Similarly, Copper concentration ranged from 0.339mg/kg in Omida market to 0.719 mg/kg in Lafenwa market. The highest concentration of Cadmium was at Lafenwa market with a value of 0.06 mg/kg. Lafenwa market showed the highest concentration of the three metals and the trend of metal concentration was of the order Pb > Cu > Cd. The levels of contamination of the snail samples were lower than the recommended FAO/WHO levels. However, there is need for regular periodic checking of heavy metals level of edible snails available in open market to safe guard the health of the general public."}
