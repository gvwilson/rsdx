{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/pope.v64.4", "year": 2022, "abstract": "The quantitative quadrat surveys and carbon/nitrogen stable isotope analyses were conducted to compare the microhabitat and trophic niches among Karaftohelix land snails in Northeast Asia. All the results indicated that the differences in microhabitats and trophic niches among Karaftohelix land snails-especially between the most closely related sister species, K. editha and K. gainesi in northern Japan-were too small to promote the adaptive radiation in this group. Therefore, it is difficult to explain the extreme divergence of phenotypes and species among Karaftohelix land snails based on environmental adaptation through resource competition and/or reproductive interference."}
