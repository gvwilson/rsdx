However, carbonate ingestion and variable metabolic rates complicate these relationships. We evaluate if live-collected snails from Lanzarote (Canary Islands) reflect the abundance of C 3 and CAM plants. Snails were collected on either CAM or C 3 plants for isotope analysis of shell and body, and shell size. Respective shell and body δ 13 C values of snails collected on CAM plants averaged − 8.5 ± 1.7‰ and − 22.8 ± 1.6‰, whereas specimens from C 3 plants averaged − 10.1 ± 0.7‰ and − 24.9 ± 1.1‰. A flux balance model suggests snails experienced comparable metabolic rates. A two-source mass balance equation implies that snails consumed ~ 10% of CAM, which agrees with their abundance in the landscape. Snails collected on CAM plant were smaller than those on C 3 plants. Conclusively: 1) snails consume CAM plants when they are available; 2) migration of snails among C 3 and CAM plants is a common phenomenon; and 3) C 3 plants may be a more energetic food for growth than CAM plants. This study shows that shell δ 13 C values offer approximate estimates of plants in C 3 –CAM mixed environments."}
