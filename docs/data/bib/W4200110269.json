{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.12.021", "year": 2022, "abstract": "This manuscript was conducted to spotlight the toxic effect of two sub-lethal concentrations of Methomyl (Copter) LC20 (0.075 g/L) and LC40 (0.180 g/L) on some biochemical parameters and histological alterations for land snail Monacha Cartusiana (Muller, 1774). Land snails belong to the class Gastropoda and Phylum Mollusca. This study cleared that both the used concentrations (of Copter) caused a significant increase for activities of three enzymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine amino transaminase (ALT), and Aspartate amino transaminase (AST) after 24, 48, and 72 h from exposure starting. In contrast, a total protein (TP) activity decreased at exposure for two concentrations at all lethality periods. Both concentrations of Copter (0.0.75 g/L and 0.180 g/L) have shown histological changes for land snail tissues after 96 h of exposure; digestive gland, hermaphrodite gland, foot, and mantle. Degeneration, rupture, and vacuolization for digestive cells have been shown; furthermore, hemolytic infiltration in connective tissue will be recognized for the digestive gland. The Oocyte and sperm show degenerated with deformation in the connective tissue of the hermaphrodite gland. Likewise, deformation in the muscle fiber layer of the foot in the land snail distorts the epidermis and mucus gland suffering from necrosis. Moreover, mantle shows rapture in epidermis layer, deformed in muscle fiber layer, and vacuolization and necrosis take place in mucus gland."}
