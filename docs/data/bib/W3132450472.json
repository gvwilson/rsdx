An uncontrolled expansion of this species in this region, which is characterized by a high number of endemic land snail species, is likely to result in extinctions. Therefore, we recommend the nature conservation authorities to survey the site to quantify population density and extent and to eradicate the introduced population of P. delesserti via manual collection."}
