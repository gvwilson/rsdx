Twenty-six species belonging to thirteen families of land snail were recorded. Of these, 20 species and four families are new records. Emendations of five species from the previous records were also made. Alive adults along with juvenile individuals were collected in most of the species. Since no endemic land snail species was found, we proposed that the plausible origin of these land snails might have dispersed from adjacent localities or via artificial introduction."}
