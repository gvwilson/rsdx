Taxonomy of Caucasian land snails has been studied well enough, but at the same time, the question remains concerning the distribution of some species of snails on the main areas of the Caucasus, especially its eastern part. In this regard, we have set the goal of a more detailed study of the species composition and characteristics of the geographical distribution of land snails of the mountain areas of eastern Caucasus, intramontane Dagestan. Methods. All materials were collected during expeditions of 2011-2015 in the major areas of intramontane Dagestan. We made collections and identified the species according to standard procedures. When determining the species we used common identifiers. Results. As a result of our research we registered, for the territory of intramontane Dagestan, 20 species of land snails belonging to 17 genera of 12 families, among which the most richly repre sented in species diversity can be found the Hygromiidae Tryton family, 1886, which includes in its community 35% of species of land snails of the study area. Conclusion. The findings allow obtaining complete information on the species diversity and characteristics of the geographical distribution of land snails in the intramontane part of Dagestan."}
