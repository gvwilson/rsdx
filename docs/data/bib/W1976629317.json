All studied\r\nenzymes, amylase, Î±-glucosidase, cellulase, lipase,\r\nand protease, were detected on the gut regions\r\n(oesophagus, crop, stomach and intestine).\r\nAestivated snails had significantly lower enzyme\r\nactivities in all the gut regions than the active\r\nsnails. Furthermore the stomach recorded the\r\nhighest enzyme activities of all the gut regions"}
