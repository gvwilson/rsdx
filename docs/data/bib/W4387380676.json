The habitat quality of these grasslands is often influenced by neighbouring forests or intensively managed agricultural land. For example, shrubs encroaching on grassland reduce the sensitive habitat, but at the same time represent a new habitat type (transition zone at gradual forest edge). We investigated the effects of gradual and abrupt forest edges on the species richness, abundance, species composition, functional diversity and number of species of conservation importance (red-listed species) of land snail assemblages at forestâ€“pasture transitions in the Jura Mountains, Switzerland. Forest edge type influenced the snail assemblages in different ways. Transition zones at abrupt forest edges had a higher species richness and more snail individuals than transition zones at gradual forest edges. Transition zones also differed in land snail species composition. At gradual forest edges, the transition zones contained some openland snail species, while those at abrupt forest edges had a similar species composition to the forest interior. Functional diversity was significantly higher for snails in the forests and transition zones at both abrupt and gradual edges than in pastures. In contrast, pastures and transition zones at both abrupt and gradual edges had a significantly higher number of red-listed snail species. Based on our findings, we recommend the creation of gradual forest edges through regular forest management practices, rather than through shrub encroachment into pasture, which could reduce the size of the threatened habitat."}
