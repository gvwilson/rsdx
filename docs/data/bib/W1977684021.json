The diploid number 2n = 60 with the chromosome formula n = 28m + 2 sm and FN = 120 were obtained. On the basis of chromosome lengths the karyotype has been prepared and the morphometric analysis has been done. The haploid number n = 30 has been confirmed and the behaviour of germinal chromosomes have been studied. Conservativeness with regard to chromosomal change in Mollusca has been discussed."}
