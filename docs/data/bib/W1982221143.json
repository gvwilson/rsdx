Cells taken from active snails synthesized specific low molecular weight proteins while those from aestivated snails did not. Most of the newly synthesized low molecular weight proteins in the active snails were lost from the cell body when the preparations was chased for 19 h in label‐free enriched medium in the presence of anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. If colchicine, a blocker of axonal transport, was included in the chase medium, the proteins present following a pulse were largely replaced by smaller molecular weight species. The results suggest that specific low molecular weight proteins are converted to smaller species and then transported from the cell body."}
