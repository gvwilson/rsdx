{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/23802359.2016.1219631", "year": 2016, "abstract": "In this study, we report the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Achatinella sowerbyana, an endangered Hawaiian tree snail. The mitogenome is 15,374 bp in length and has a base composition of A (36.4%), T (42.7%), C (9.1%), and G (11.8%). Similar to other pulmonates, it contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes. The gene order is the same as its sister species, A. mustelina. To our knowledge, this is the second mitochondrial genome sequenced within the superfamily Achatinelloidea, and will aid in the examination of the genus Achatinella, part of a spectacular radiation in the Hawaiian Islands."}
