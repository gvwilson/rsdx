Analysis of snail farm soil indicated a high number of heterotrophic bacteria (7.20x10 5 to 9.60x10 5 cfu/g) than the farmland soil (1.06x10 5 to 4.40x10 5 cfu/g). The snail shell effluent contained 1.9x10 5 to 2.28x10 5 cfu/ml. Coliform bacteria was 1200 MPN/100g in the snail farm soil, 260 MPN/100g in the unimpacted farmland soil, 480 MPN/100ml in the visceral mass and 160MPN/100ml in the sail shell effluent. Counts of Vibrios recorded were in the ranges of 1.80x10 4 to 3.2x10 4 cfu/g for the snail farm soil, 4.0x10 4 to 2.70x10 5 cfu/ml in the snail shell affluent and 0 to 1.30x10 4 cfu/ml in the visceral mass. None was recorded in the unimpacted farmland soil. Staphylococcus species was in the range of 1.48x10 3 to 2.6x10 3 to 1.6x10 4 cfu/ml in the snail shell effluent and 2.40x10 to 4.8x10cfu/ml in the visceral mass. Pseudomonas/Aeromonas species were low in number in the farmland soil (0 to 1.06x10 2 cfu/g), snail farm soil (1.1x10 3 to 2.1x10 3 cfu/g), snail shell effluent (7.1x10 2 to 2.20x10 3 cfu/ml) and visceral mass (2.69x10 2 to 3.2x10 2 cfu/ml).Other bacterial genera isolated from the farms included Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Bacillus, Klebsiella, Streptococcus and Proteus, and these occurred in higher numbers than in the unimpacted farmland soil.
