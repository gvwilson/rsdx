Microbial examination revealed that the gastropod was contaminated with (Klepcella) a harmful bacteria of man and animals and (Burkhelderia ceptacia) a non-useful bacteria in mucus. Few data were dealing with contamination of Monacha land snail in Egypt so, this study aims to highlight in this respect for taking into a sustainable infection when contact and thoroughly washing vegetables and fruits that are favorable food for Monacha land snails.Our results showed noticeable damage of cabbage leaves by Monacha snails in laboratory (26. 93%) and field (39. 23%) as a general mean value of cabbage consumption. Beneficial effects were revealed through biochemical analysis of both gastropod and shell components. Analysis revealed that Monacha sp.rich in protean (17.9%) and minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium. Calcium determined the highest (Ca, 13%), followed by phosphorus (Ph., 0.60%), magnesium (Mg, 0.12%) and potassium (K, 0.094%) so, the second aim of our study is the revealing of the economic feature of Monacha land snails as an addition to the fodder of farm animals and in traditional medicine."}
