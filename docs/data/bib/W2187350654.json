{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.18475/cjos.v46i1.a2", "year": 2010, "abstract": "Late Pleistocene terrestrial faunas of Jamaica are typically found in limestone caves and fissures. Unusually, lithified sand dunes at Great Pedro Bluff, parish of St. Elizabeth, have yielded a biota of land snails and rhizoliths. The land snails include Poteria? sp., Sagda sp. cf. S. delaminata (C. B. Adams), Pleurodonte sp. cf. P. lucerna (MÃ¼ller) and Pleurodonte sp. 2. These are all large, ground dwelling genera that are widely distributed in other mid-late Pleistocene land snail bearing deposits of Jamaica, as well as the Recent. Small species are not present at Great Pedro Bluff, probably a taphonomic artifact rather than collection failure. Amino acid racemization ratios from Pleurodonte tentatively suggest an oxygen isotope stage 5e correlation; morphostratigraphic correlation previously suggested a younger, Wisconsin age, which still seems more likely."}
