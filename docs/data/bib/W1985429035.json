Most of the evidence for this phenomenon comes from experiments using artificial prey items distinguished by simple artificial colour differences. We describe an experiment performed at 10 different sites in which we tested whether selection by wild birds is anti‐apostatic when presented with high density populations of shells of the polymorphic land snail, Cepaea hortensis , stuffed with pastry. At each site we presented two sorts of populations in sequence: 45 yellow unbanded with 5 yellow banded, and 5 yellow unbanded with 45 yellow banded. Selection was measured using an analysis based on generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) that has broad applicability to all resource selection studies where extraneous variance is a problem. Using this analytic method, we found that birds altered their behaviour to produce significant anti‐apostatic selection in direct response to changes in frequency of the quasi‐natural Cepaea morphs."}
