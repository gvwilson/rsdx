Land plants have found two different solutions to this challenge: avoidance and tolerance. The closest algal relatives to land plants, the Zygnematophyceae, use the latter, and how this is realized is of great interest for our understanding of the conquest of land. Here, we worked with two representatives of the Zygnematophyceae, Zygnema circumcarinatum SAG 698‐1b and Mesotaenium endlicherianum SAG 12.97, who differ in habitats and drought resilience. We challenged both algal species with severe desiccation in a laboratory setup until photosynthesis ceased, followed by a recovery period. We assessed their morphological, photophysiological, and transcriptomic responses. Our data pinpoint global differential gene expression patterns that speak of conserved responses, from calcium‐mediated signaling to the adjustment of plastid biology, cell envelopes, and amino acid pathways, between Zygnematophyceae and land plants despite their strong ecophysiological divergence. The main difference between the two species appears to rest in a readjustment of the photobiology of Zygnema , while Mesotaenium experiences stress beyond a tipping point."}
