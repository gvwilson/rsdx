There is only one anedoctal record of C. nemoralis from Montreal, Canada, but without a date or an exact location. In this note, recent records of C. nemoralis are presented for Montreal, based on surveys from 7 to 9 August 2009 along a southwest to northeast transect parallel to the Montreal-Dorion-Rigaud commuter railroad."}
