We consider the behavioural ecology of three morphologically similar, parapatric camaenids of southeast Australia: Meridolum corneovirens, Meridolum middenense, and Pommerhelix duralensis. We critically review available literature on their behaviour and address knowledge gaps through field and laboratory studies, including spool-line tracking data for P. duralensis and M. corneovirens. These data are supplemented by in situ observation for each species and ex situ dietary preference studies for P. duralensis and M. corneovirens. Our results suggest a complex behavioural ecology for each species, with some inter-specific behavioural differences within the morphologically conservative group. Implications for invertebrate conservation planning are briefly discussed."}
