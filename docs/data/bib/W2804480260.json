The fossiliferous outcrops belong to the Silvana Beds unit of the Upper Freshwater Molasse group, of late Early to early Middle Miocene age (Neogene European Land Mammal Zone MN 5). In total, 35 gastropod species were found (seven freshwater and 28 terrestrial), mainly belonging to Pulmonata, but also with representatives of Neritimorpha and Caenogastropoda. Seven species are reported here for the first time from Dischingen: Palaina diezi, Radix socialis, Granaria sp., Serrulina? sp., Discus pleuradrus, Punctum pumilio, and Oxyloma minima."}
