An example is pollination gardens that support free-moving butterflies and bees. Pollination gardens and other areas with plants also support a wide range of other non-captive animals, including soil-associated invertebrates. This study targeted land snails, a species-rich group that links the brown decomposition food web and the plant-based web that is preyed upon by fireflies and birds, among others. A survey of 24 sites within the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden revealed a diverse snail fauna of 23 species. The majority were native species but included 10 non-native species that are common regional urban species, likely introduced through the plant trade. No distributional pattern of snails was evident, probably because of the similar management scheme throughout the zoo. Snails and other observed soil-associated invertebrates (e.g., isopods, millipedes, and earthworms) support non-captive birds and other animals. Lightly managed areas with leaf litter and downed wood are especially conducive to snails and other soil-associated invertebrates and are nesting sites for bees. These communities can form conservation demonstration areas that can be the basis of educational programs, including outreach programs."}
