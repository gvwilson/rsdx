The results showed that methomyl exhibited greater efficacy than did methiocarb against the snails in both techniques. However, higher mortality rates were obtained in the topical application technique than in the poison bait experiments. Biochemical and histochemical examinations revealed that treatment of the snails with methomyl and methiocarb either by topical application or toxic baits caused significant decrease in carbohydrate, lipid and protein contents. This decrease was also more obvious after topical application than after baiting technique, and methomyl was found to be more toxic than methiocarb."}
