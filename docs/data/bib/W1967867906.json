SCP also declined in autumn in Discus conrkhitei (Newcomb) and Gastrocopta armifera (Say). 2.|Supercooling ability varied among the species, being the greatest in G. armifera. 3.|Prolonged exposure of winter animals to high temperatures resulted in only a modest increase in SCP. 4.|Low temperature survival of D. cronkhitei and G. armifera was slightly poorer than predicted by the mean SCP."}
