A high genetic variability level and low values of inbreeding coefficient were characteristic of most colonies. Weak genetic separation of the snail groups studied was also demonstrated. Invasive colony distribution was supposed to correspond to the island model. The calculation of effective population size and the comparison of this value to the respective parameters of native and invasive species of terrestrial mollusks revealed a high viability level for the population of the species of interest in the study area."}
