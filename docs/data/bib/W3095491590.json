Their current taxonomy is predominantly shell morphology based, and it remains unknown whether the morphologically differentiated and geographically separated populations represent phylogenetic clades. In this study, we analysed the hyperdiverse, terrestrial door snail genus Montenegrina. Based on the current taxonomy defined by shell morphology, it contains 29 species and 106 subspecies distributed in the Balkan region. The constructed phylogenetic tree using three mitochondrial markers was used to test whether it agrees with the current taxonomy. In this comprehensive tree, about half of the species and subspecies are monophyletic. Some of the paraphylies could be reasonably resolved by taxonomic changes; that is, some subspecies should be reassigned or raised to species level. Other incongruencies probably arose due to introgression even between distant clades. The histone genes turned out to be unsuitable for elucidating the phylogeny of Montenegrina. In the species-delimitation tests, considerably more molecular operational taxonomic units were delimited than the number of presently described species. The present data indicate that (a) shell morphology-based taxonomy and taxon recognition can be problematic in such a large and morphologically highly variable genus; (b) the potential error due to incomplete sampling presents a problem in a genus as variable as Montenegrina; (c) multi-locus analyses should be conducted to arrive at a better basis for species delimitation; and (d) integrative approaches including genetic as well as morphological/anatomical data from a comprehensive geographic sample are necessary."}
