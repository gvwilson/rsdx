Here we report finding an individual Euhadra quaesita quaesita (Deshayes, 1850) showing total albinism. In contrast to the mosaic of dark and light-brown bumps on the soft body of wild-type E. quaesita quaesita, the soft body of the albino individual was white or pale yellow, except for the head wart. We hypothesize the color of the head wart is derived from sex hormones as melanin pigments were lost in head-wart epithelial cells. Finding an albino E. quaesita quaesita opens opportunities for multiple new lines of inquiry."}
