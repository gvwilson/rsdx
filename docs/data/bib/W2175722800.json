Eurema brigitta brigitta was the most abundant butterfly whereas Thapsia karamwegasensis was the most abundant land snail. Majority of the butterfly species are found in open formations and about 50 % of them have a widespread distribution in Africa, while the land snails were forest species known only from Eastern Africa. Ndere island appears to support low levels of biodiversity although further monitoring is necessary."}
