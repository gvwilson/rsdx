Cerithidea obtusa is exploited with varying sizes. This research was conducted at intertidal zone of Pulau Tebing Tinggi beach, Meranti Island regency, Riau from May to June 2017. The objective of the research was to analyse morphometric variation and long-term relationship of Cerithidea obtusa. Samples of Cerithidea obtusa were randomly collected and morphometric parameters measured included shell length, shell width, spire height, shell opening length, shell opening width, and shell depth using digital calipers. The results showed that the long shell of Cerithidea obtusa varied between 21-43 mm, while the width of the shell varied between 13-24 mm. Cerithidea obtusa has a low spire with an oval body shape based on the ratio of shell length to shell width parameters, spire height, shell opening length, shell opening width and shell depth. The relative growth pattern of Cerithidea obtusa is negative allometric."}
