This three-year study aimed to develop a simple, but effective system for protecting breeders in colder climates. (2) Methods: The first phase investigated the (pre)hibernal burrowing behavior and the overwintering habitat choice. Protective structures based on straw, LFC, and/or HDPE were tested at pilot level (no snails). The most suitable system was applied under farm conditions. (3) Results: Wood and ridge-tile micro shelters were significantly preferred to corrugated iron micro shelters. Burrowing specimens acted as shallow-burrowers, and this behaviorwas significantly more common for looser soils. All pilot systems displayed significantly higher thermal protection efficiency compared to the sole use of LFC. The balance between straw moistening and thermal protection favored using structure soil/LFC/straw/10-cm air cushion/HDPE. Its use yielded significantly higher survival compared to the sole use of LFC. Most hibernating snails clustered together in large groups, attached on the lower surface of micro shelters. Predator occurrence appeared to marginally affect overwintering survival. (4) Conclusions: The “sandwich” system could be an effective solution for overwintering mature C. aspersum snails in colder climates."}
