If soil Ca is important to land snails, then land snail communities may be sensitive to reductions in soil Ca, including those caused by atmospheric acid deposition. In this study, snail density was estimated at ten 200m2 plots in mature forest using a litter sieving technique, and species richness was determined from litter sieving and timed searches. The most abundant snail species was the small spot, Punctum minutissimum (I. Lea), representing 34% of the specimens collected. Land snail density and species richness were positively correlated with extractable Ca, water soluble Ca, and pH in the Oe soil horizon and in the horizon below. Basal area of sugar maple, Acer saccharum Marsh., was positively associated with snail density and Ca in the Oe horizon, while basal area of red maple, Acer rubrum L., was negatively associated with snail density and Ca in the Oe horizon."}
