This large terrestrial and herbivorous snail inhabits the lowland forests with a narrow geographical distribution. The species is characterized by having a large shell, roundly angulated peripheries adjacent to the peristome, an open umbilicus, a robust flagellum, a weak expansion on male genitalia instead of a penial caecum externally and a hemispherical verge instead of an elongated pilaster internally. A key is provided for the first time to identify camaenids from Taiwan."}
