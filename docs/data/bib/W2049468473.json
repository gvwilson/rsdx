Analyses of 18 O of the shell carbonate of 76 radiocarbon-dated Holocene samples of the land snail Trochoidea seetzeni from the northern Negev Desert in southern Israel were carried out and the results were compared to modern snails from the same region. Early Holocene δ 18 O values are similar to modern but during the period centered around 6500-6000 yr B.P., a depletion of some 2%. below modern is observed. A change in the atmospheric circulation pattern for this period is thus indicated, most likely an increase in the frequency of storm systems reaching the region from north-eastern Africa. By 3500 yr B.P., δ 18 O values had reached modern levels and indicate a stable pattern of atmospheric circulation since that time."}
