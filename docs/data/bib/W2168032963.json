{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1477200005001854", "year": 2006, "abstract": "Abstract The endemic Sri Lankan land‐snail genus Ratnadvipia is reviewed and a new species is described. Detailed descriptions of the shell, external morphology of the animal, reproductive anatomy, spermatophore and radula of Ratnadvipia irradians and the new species are provided. Distributional data collected to date for the two species are reviewed. Both species are associated with the highly fragmented rain forests of Sri Lanka's wet southwestern quarter. R. irradians is the most wide‐ranging of Sri Lanka's endemic land snails. It extends into the drier parts of the island and occurs in synanthropic habitats such as home gardens. The new species is largely restricted to the lowland rain forests of the southern part of the wet lowlands. Both species appear to be at least partly arboreal, but little is known of their ecology.
