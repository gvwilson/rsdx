A survey in the Togari forest block in northwest Tasmania suggests that the species occurs in a wide range of forest habitats but requires deep leaf litter to survive, and is more frequent in the north of the block. Knowledge gained from this survey , combined with known records, suggests a range of at least 25,000 hectares and an improved outlook for the species."}
