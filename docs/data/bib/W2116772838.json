Demographic analysis of the populations of C. vindobonensis revealed that a) three cohorts were present in the field throughout the year, b) the reproductive period started in late April-May and the newly hatched snails appeared in the beginning of June, and c) increased growth rates were observed during spring and early summer, but also during autumn for the newly hatched snails."}
