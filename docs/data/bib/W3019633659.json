LC50 and LC90 values were (2.84 and 18.75 %), (1.97 and 4.57 %), (4.99 and 25.29 %) and (0.63 and 2.56 %), respectively. While LC50 and LC90 as poison bait fore mention before biocides were (2.04 and 37.3%), (2.08 and 5.97 %), (3.45 and 19.50 %) and (0.51 and 2.13 %), respectively in laboratory.\r\nResults of the field experiments showed that the tested biocides reduced Monacha sp. Population density on pea plantation with low values, except, Vertimec (83.32%) after 21 days residue effect. While Molluscicides were the most effective (up to 90 % ) to population density reduction of land snails infesting pea plantation compared with tested biocides compound."}
