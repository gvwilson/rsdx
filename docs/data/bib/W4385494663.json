On the other hand, species of microgastropods remain undersampled and overlooked. Based on recently collected shells from Mount Vauclin, we describe a new species of Scolodontidae, Miradiscops madinina sp. nov. from Martinique. This is the first recorded incidence of Miradiscops stricto sensu from the volcanic arc of the Lesser Antilles, as well as the second species of Scolodontidae recorded from Martinique. This emphasises the importance of Mount Vauclin as a home to endemic invertebrates on the island and the need for collection efforts that includes soil and leaf litter sampling."}
