Its biology and behavioral patterns are unrecognized. This study focuses on population dynamics of C. edentula and investigates the tendency of the species to climb up plants. The field researches were carried out at a moist sedge meadow in western Poland during two growing seasons (spring and summer of 2008 and 2009). The data analysis revealed differences in patterns of climbing behavior and population dynamics in the studied period."}
