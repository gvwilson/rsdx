Snails were killed by freezing. 2. Thermal acclimation of August snails to +5°C was associated first with a reduction of water content and later with a significant depression in SCP. Exposure to +5°C and −5°C depressed mean SCP in March animals. 3. Polyhydric alcohols (glycerol, sorbitol and mannitol) were not detected in the haemolymph of December snails. 4. Gut evacuation and reduced water content in the fall coupled with thermal acclimatization during overwintering were considered to be major determinants of SCP."}
