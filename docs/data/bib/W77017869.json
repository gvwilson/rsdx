{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.31274/rtd-180813-6664", "year": 2018, "abstract": "Population sizes were estimated for fourteen Discus niacclintocki populations and ranged from 182 to 22,097 individuals. Estimation procedures from both Bayesian and more common methods gave similar results, although the Baysian method allowed estimation of some populations that could not be estimated with common methods due to small sample sizes. The snails rarely moved over the surface, and never more than eight meters. A comparison of two methods of sampling, visual counts of quadrats and cover boards, showed that using cover boards resulted in much higher probabilities of capture, number of recaptures, and percent recaptures. Snail activity was highly variable over time and space, which makes precise estimation difficult."}
