It is a destructive land snail as they cause great damage to vegetables and crops. The present study aimed to control snails by ultraviolet radiation. Snails under study were subjected to the same dose of UV-A radiation for two different periods. The source of radiation was UV-fluorescent lamps, UV-A 366â€‰nm. Small pieces of mantle edge, foot, digestive gland, and intestine of treated and untreated snails were taken and prepared for histological examination by light microscope. While small pieces of mantle edge and foot only were prepared for scanning electron microscopic examination. Histopathological changes in the mantle, foot, digestive gland, and intestine of treated snails were studied. The changes included destruction and disorganization of many cell types. UV-A radiation affected the fitness of the snails; they became less active. The changes in different organs will lead to alteration in their functions. UV-A has a destructive effect on different organs of the snails under study. This effect will lead to the control of this snail (Monacha obstructa)."}
