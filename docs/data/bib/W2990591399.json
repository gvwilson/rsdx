Our study reveals that the average Δ47 temperature (T47) of modern snails is consistent with monitored temperatures during the snail growing season at the studied locations and is ~10 °C higher than that of fossil snails from glacial time. Moreover, the average δ13Cshell of modern snails is more depleted than that of fossils. We argue that the δ13Cshell cannot record changes in plant communities (i.e., the C3/C4 ratio) on the CLP and may mainly indicate arid conditions with depleted values reflecting reduced aridity. Additionally, the reconstructed snail body water δ18O (δ18Owater) of modern snails is more enriched than δ18O in modern growing season precipitation and δ18Owater of fossils. This contrast may be related to the high degree of evaporative enrichment of environmental water 18O in the body/ingested by modern snails under warm conditions. Therefore, we suggest that using δ18Oshell to directly reconstruct the oxygen isotopes of precipitation is difficult and that higher δ18Oshell and δ18Owater values probably indicate higher environmental temperature/stronger evaporative enrichment on glacial-interglacial timescales on the CLP."}
