A population from Ramal dos Mosteiros was studied all year round in order to elucidate its reproductive cycle and to test the validity of the total weight of the animal and the maximum diameter of the shell as diagnostic parameters for maturation. Gonadal maturation of L. caldeirarum proceeds from late winter to early summer. Intense gametogenesis takes place from January until May and the snail is apparently in a reproductive condition to copulate from late spring onwards. The strong correlation observed between the relative volumetric density of mature gametes and the maximum diameter of th..."}
