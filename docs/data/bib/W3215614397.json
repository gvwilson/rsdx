Material and Methods: LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of the each tested compound of natural compounds were estimated after 14 days of treatment, while LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of pesticide were evaluated after 72 hrs of treatment. The impact of LC&lt;sub&gt;50 &lt;/sub&gt;of each tested compound on some biochemical parameters, total protein content, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activity were determined 48 hrs post treatment. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The results revealed that the methomyl and lambda-cyhalothrin were the most effective compounds against test land snails, followed by Repcar, Top-nine and Techno oil, while Berna Star and Nema Ultra Chem come in the last rank. The pesticide compound methomyl was the most toxic one against the tested terrestrial snail species, while the Chitosan 5% was the least toxic one. The results showed that all tested compounds caused fluctuated effect whether increasing or decreasing on all the studies parameters such as total protein content, ALP and ACP activity as well. However, the Techno oil and the Berna Star caused sever decreasing on total protein content and ACP, followed by Top-nine, Repcar, Chitosan 5% (Nema Ultra Chem) and plant extracts. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The both tested natural compounds and plant extracts recorded satisfying results compared with methomyl and lambda-cyhalothrin effect and that can be used in the pest controlling programs against terrestrial snails to reduce the environmental pollution."}
