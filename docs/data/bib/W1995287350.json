Carbon isotopic compositions (δ 13 C values) of modern and archaeological adult snail shell carbonates suggest significant (>60%) dietary input of C 3 plants during all periods. Oxygen isotopic compositions of shells suggest that the isotopic composition of environmental water available at the time of shell growth has changed little over the period of the profile. A linearly decreasing trend in δ 13 C of soil organic matter from −22.8‰ at the bottom of the profile (115 cm below surface) to −25.6‰ for modern surface samples indicate an overall 20% increase in abundance of C 3 plants. This implies a progressively wetter climate and less severe water stress conditions or decreasing summer rainfall that is in agreement with other studies on Late Holocene climate change in the southern Great Plains, USA. These results strongly suggest a stable climate that favored C 3 vegetation in this portion of Texas during this period."}
