The biosynthesis and composition of sterols and sterol esters were studied in the land snail Cepaea nemoralis after injection of Na-1-14C-acetate. 2. Free and esterified sterols appeared to be synthesized by the animals, whilst the specific radioactivity of the sterols from the esters was found to be higher than that of the free sterols after incubation for 48 hr. 3. The composition of sterols in both fractions was not significantly different. 4. The fatty acid moiety of the sterol esters appeared to be labeled as well and involved about sixty components, which are summarized from myristic acid onwards."}
