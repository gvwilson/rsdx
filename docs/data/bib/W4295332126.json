This ethnographic study aims to throw light on this phenomenon. The consumption of land snails is one of the important culinary traditions of a large part of the current Tunisian population. Collected terrestrial gastropods and their preparation vary from one region to another and from one family to another. Consumption techniques depend on the position of the body of the mollusc at the entrance of the shell after cooking and the consumer's mastery of extraction techniques. In addition to simple extraction, the piercing of the shells, by human canines or by any other tool, offers an effective solution for removal of the animal from the shell. The position of the perforation on the shell (upper or lower part) is related to the part of the mollusc flesh desired by the consumer."}
