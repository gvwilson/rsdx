The land snail (40–45 mm diameter) was on its back with its foot under the frog (38.5 mm snout-vent length), raising the possibility that this was a predation attempt by the snail. Carnivorous endemic land snails are only known to consume a range of invertebrate species, especially earthworms. Our observation suggests that these snails might also opportunistically attempt to consume small ground vertebrates, although definitive evidence is required."}
