The apparent inhibitory constant for the block of potassium delayed current was about 25 Î¼M. 3. Quinidine induces an increase in the inactivation rate, probably independent of the effects upon current amplitude. 4. These results differ of those described in literature for other preparations, and may reflect specific properties of potassium-delayed channels of land snail neurons."}
