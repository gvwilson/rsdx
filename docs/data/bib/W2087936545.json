Kidneys and excreta of two pulmonate land snail species, Mesomphix vulgatus and Euglandina rosea, were analyzed for non-protein nitrogen components. 2. Mesomphix was found to void no excretory material. 3. Uric acid and guanine were the only two purines found. 4. Guanine was present in significantly higher amounts in Mesomphix kidneys than in Euglandina and may enable Mesomphix, an annual species, to go through life without excreting any nitrogen."}
