(Primulaceae), nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) (Solanaceae) and nutsedge (Cyperus longus L.) (Cyperaceae) were evaluated against the adult stage of Monacha obstructa (Pfeiffer, 1842) under laboratory conditions. Three methods of bioassay were used i.e. bait, residual film (contact) and antifeeding techniques. The results indicated that chloroform and hexane extracts of primpernel appeared highly toxic when applied as baits on M. obstructa adults while nutsedge was found to be lower toxicity based on LC50 values. Also, chloroform extract of nightshade and hexane extract of primpernel were the most potent with contact whereas nutsedge was the least effective. On the other hand, of either chloroform or hexane extract primpernel tended to be more effective as antifeedant compound than nightshade. In contrast, nutsedge chloroform extract revealed no action as a feeding deterrent whereas the same hexane extract was effective based on SC50 levels. Moreover, fifteen compounds were identified by GC/MS analysis in the chloroform extract of primpernel. Palmatic acid methyl ester (fatty acid) was the dominant compound representing 25.8% followed by aromadendrene (sesquiterpene) forming 15.2% and 2 – tertbutyl - 4- isopropyl – 5- methylphenol (phenolic compound) having 13.9%. In addition to the presence of two steroids, two dicarboxylic acids and only one ketone compound was identified. Finally, the salt of carbamic acid (ammonium carbamate) and the ester of phosphoric acid (tributyl phosphate) were also detected. This study reveals that chemical compounds present in chloroform extract of primpernel has effective source as a molluscicide extracted of plant origin and has potential beneficial control against M. obstructa snails."}
