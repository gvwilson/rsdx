{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.35885/ruthenica.2018.28(3).2", "year": 2018, "abstract": "37 species of the land molluscs were identified in the material collected in 2002-2017, many being earlier unknown from Zaporozhye region. In total 39 species of molluscs can be considered as reliably recorded from this region. The presence of some species is the result of anthropochory. This concerns first of all those land snails which have spread from the Crimea: Brephulopsis bidens, B. cylindrica, Phenacolimax annularis, Oxychilus deilus, Monacha fruticola, Xeropicta derbentina, X. krynickii, Eobania vermiculata, Helix lucorum. One species (Xerolenta obvia) was introduced to Zaporozhye region from the western part of Ukraine. The data obtained made it possible to clarify the current distribution of Helicopsis retowskii and Chondrula tridens martynovi over the territory of Ukraine."}
