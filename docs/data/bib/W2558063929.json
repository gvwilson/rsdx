Mixed sex crabs were fed with trash fish, golden apple snail and combination of trash fish and golden apple snail at 10% body weight. Growth, survival, moulting and picked meat yield and quality were evaluated. Specific growth rate and survival were highest in crabs fed with golden apple snail and combination. Moulting was significantly affected by diet types. There was no significant difference in the yield of picked meat and overall acceptability scores. Golden apple snail could be a potential dietary substitute for trash fish."}
