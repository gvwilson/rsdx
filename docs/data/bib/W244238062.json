Ten culture pens were stocked with snails at 20%, 40%, 50%, 80% and 100% capacity with each group in 2 replicates. Average weight gain of brooders was highest in pens stocked at 40% population density while the lowest was in pen stocked at 100%. Average number of eggs laid per snail and average number of eggs per pen followed the same trend in the study. The highest average number of eggs laid per pen was obtained in pens stocked at 60% population density (586) while the least was from pens at 20% population density. The result was the same for the average number of eggs laid per snail i.e. 7.5 eggs in pens stocked at 60% and 4.1 eggs in pens stocked at 20%. There was no significant difference in the weights of hatchlings in the different pens."}
