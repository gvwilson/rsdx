Three limestone gorges were analysed located in the southeast of the Metaliferi Mountains. Four different habitats in three limestone gorges were analysed â€“ Glodului, Cibului and Mada. A total of 42 species of land snails were identified. The terrestrial gastropod communities in the area are dominated by calciphile species, such as Granaria frumentum, Truncatellina cylindrica and Alopia bielzii madensis. The differences between the analysed habitats are not pronounced enough to be reflected in the structure of the snail communities. Significant positive correlation was found between the abundance of land snails and the habitat exposure."}
