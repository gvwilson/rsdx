They belong to 25 species (six families), of which two are still unidentified, and show a high level of endemism. Currently known species have been predominantly collected from the Eastern Pantepui region, with limited data on their anatomy. Information on ecology and biogeography is summarized from previous papers and suggestions are made for future research."}
