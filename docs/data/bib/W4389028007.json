The snail species use the stem and bark of five plant species (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Mangifera indica, Aegle marmelos, Swietenia macrophylla, and Roseodendron donnell-smithii) as microhabitat, and the most preferred host plant was A. marmelos (Jacobs’ selectivity index Dia= 0.5 ± 0.19). The mean ± SE values of shell height (SH), shell width (SW), aperture length (AL), aperture width (AW), body weight, apical angle (AA) and spire ratio (SR) of the collected specimens were measured as 1.95 ± 0.06 mm, 1.03 ± 0.01 mm, 0.54 ± 0.02 mm, 0.74 ± 0.02 mm, 0.86 ± 0.06 mg, 0.55 ± 0.02, and 1.89 ± 0.06, respectively. The present study will be informative to frame conservation strategies for I. malayana in India and elsewhere."}
