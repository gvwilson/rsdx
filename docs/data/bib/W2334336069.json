Hemolymph oxygenation properties and in vivo arterial and venous O₂ tensions showed that half the O₂-binding capacity of Hc is exploited in O₂ transport and that Hc is responsible for two-thirds of the O₂ delivered to the tissues in nonestivating animals. The Bohr effect was strongly biphasic; at 20° C, the partial pressure of O₂ at 50% Hc saturation (P50) was maximal near pH 7.9 and decreased at higher and lower pH values, whereas this inflection was shifted to higher pH (8.4-8.5) at 10° C The Hill cooperativity coefficient (n50) showed similar pH and temperature dependence. The overall heat of oxygenation of whole Hc and of the isolated α-Hc component varied with pH and was dependent on the O₂ saturation of the Hc molecules. The Hill plots of the native He showed unusual triphasicity (n10 > n50 < n90) at low pH, which correlates with the presence of two Hc components that exhibit different O₂ affinities. At pH > 7.6, n50was suppressed by CO₂, while there uwas no specific CO₂ effect on P50. The findings are interpreted in terms of the possible physiological role of Hc in gastropods."}
