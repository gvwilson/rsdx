In the present study, Cantareus aspersus juveniles, were exposed in two successive phases of 30 days each, to soil spiked with increasing concentrations of copper sulfate. Copper concentrated preferentially and in a dose-dependent manner in the hepatopancreas. In the case of specimens previously exposed to Cu-spiked soils, Cu retention kinetics were independent from the effects of a new exposure event. There was no effect on shell growth, but significant mortality was observed at 60 days. The no observed effect concentration and the lowest observed effect concentration for mortality in snails, were Ëœ 41 and 54 mg, respectively, per grams dry weight in the hepatopancreas. The results demonstrate, for the first time, that terrestrial gastropods can accumulate soil Cu autonomously from dietary uptake."}
