{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7910199", "year": 2007, "abstract": "The familial relationships of the enigmatic southern African land snail genus Prestonella have recently been resolved and the genus shown to be the sole known African representative of the Gondwanan family Bulimulidae s.l. In this paper I present a taxonomic revision of the genus and provide further data on the distribution, habitat preferences and conservation of the species. The genus is represented by three described species, P. bowkeri (type species), P. nuptialis and P. quadingensis, but the validity of the latter as taxon distinct from P. nuptialis is doubtful. A lectotype is designated for Bulimus bowkeri Sowerby. The species exhibit highly fragmented, relictual distributions associated with specialised habitats along the southern edge of the Great Escarpment, and are likely to become increasingly threatened as a result of climate change."}
