This study evaluates the levels of essential elements (Mn, Mg, P, Ca, K, Cu, Na, Zn and Fe) and proximate composition (protein, fat, moisture, carbohydrate, fibre and ash) of three snail species namely; Achatina achatina, Achatina fulica and Archachatina marginata species from the Kumasi Central Market. The mineral content and proximate composition of the three land snail species' shell and meat were analysed using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry and other Standard Methods of Analysis. The study revealed that the three snail species differed in the composition of significant nutrients and trace elements in meat. It is evident from this study that the consumption of snail meat can promote good human health, with Archachatina marginata having the best nutritional value. In the meat from the three snail species, a strong significant positive correlation between Ca and P levels was observed, and the Cu and Fe (p < 0.05). In both the proximate and mineral analysis, each meat parameter was correspondingly higher than that of the shell for all the snail species, except for ash and Ca contents. The estimated daily intakes of Zn, Fe, Mn and Cu were lower compared with the tolerable daily intake, suggesting that the essential elements are at acceptable levels. Therefore, consumers of these land snails will gain the benefits of the proximate and mineral constituents. The shells can also be utilised as food supplements for livestock and eliminate the burden of managing snail shell waste."}
