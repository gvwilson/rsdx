{"doi": "https://doi.org/10.1079/cpc.2640.20210102948", "year": 2021, "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> The giant African land snail <italic>A. fulica</italic> is a fast-growing polyphagous plant pest that has been introduced from its native range in East Africa to many parts of the world as a commercial food source (for humans, fish and livestock) and as a novelty pet. It easily becomes attached to any means of transport or machinery at any developmental stage, is able to go into a state of aestivation in cooler conditions and so is readily transportable over distances. Once escaped it has managed to establish itself and reproduce prodigiously in tropical and some temperate locations. As a result, <italic>A. fulica</italic> has been classified as one of the world's top 100 invasive alien species by The World Conservation Union, IUCN (ISSG, 2003)."}
