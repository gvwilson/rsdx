Considered a microendemic species from mountain tops in Central Switzerland, the shell is specially adapted for life under stones. Herein, we show via molecular and anatomical investigations that F.biconica neither belongs to the land snail genus Trochulus, nor to any other genus within Trochulini, but rather warrants placement within the newly established genus Raeticella Kneub√ºhler, Baggenstos & Neubert, 2022. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that R.biconica is clearly separated from Trochulus. These findings are supported by morphological investigations of the shell and genitalia."}
