Gel filtration and density gradinet centrifugation were used to estimate the mol. wt. of arginase from the land planarian Bipalium kewense, the land snail Helix aspersa and the laughing gull Larus atricilla. The mol. wt. of arginase from the land planarian and from the land snail was ∼240,000, while that from the gull was ∼120,000. 2. A considertion of the known molecular weights of arginases from different species indicates there is no general correlation between the mol. wt. of arginase from a given species and that species' excretory nitrogen metabolism."}
