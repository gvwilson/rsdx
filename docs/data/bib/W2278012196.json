Here, we investigated the potential syndromes linking movement behaviour, body mass and male and female sexual organs development, to explain a previously described subadult dispersal pattern in the hermaphrodite land snail Cornu aspersum . We found elements indicating that this snail may not strictly be a simultaneous hermaphrodite, but presents a male‐biased phase before reaching adulthood and hermaphroditism. Body mass was positively correlated with both patch‐leaving propensity and movement speed. However, because the dry mass of the female albumen gland, which represents on average in adults masses equivalent to 42.6% of somatic soft tissues dry mass, was negatively correlated with patch‐leaving propensity, snails of intermediate age are expected to be more likely to leave than older ones. No relationship between male organ size and movement characteristics was found. We discuss briefly the interesting consequences the existence of a syndrome linking movement propensity with female investment in a protandric hermaphrodite species might have in terms of life‐history evolution and on the maintenance of hermaphroditism in dispersal‐favouring environments."}
