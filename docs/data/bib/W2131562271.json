An analysis of variance was performed on five factors: adaptation temperature, relative humidity, shell colour, age class and test temperature. There were no significant differences in the mortality between different adaptation temperatures or relative humidities, but the interaction of these two factors was highly significant. There were significant differences in mortality rate between test temperature and age class. The mortality of the brown morph was higher than the yellow one at all adaptation temperatures (overall, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the mortality rates of the two morphs at different relative humidities. The mortality of the brown morph was higher than that of the yellow at six out of seven test temperatures. Juvenile snails survived significantly better than adults at all test temperatures."}
