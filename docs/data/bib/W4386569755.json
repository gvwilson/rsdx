Consequently, the assessment of the genotoxic potential of compounds found in contaminated soils is important. Indeed, the alteration of genomic integrity may increase the risk of cancer development and may impair reproduction and long-term population dynamics. Among the methodologies to assess terrestrial genotoxic potential, there has been growing interest during the last decade in monitoring alterations of the genome in bioindicators of soil quality. As some land snail species are recognized bioindicators of soil quality, especially to assess the environmental and toxicological bioavailability of compounds, this review focuses on current knowledge regarding the genotoxicology of land snails. Classical biomarkers to assess genotoxic effects have been used (e.g., DNA breakage, micronuclei, random amplification polymorphic DNA) at various stages of the life cycle, including embryos. The studies were performed in vitro, in vivo, in situ and ex situ and covered a diverse set of contaminants (nanoparticles, metal(loid)s, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and snail species (Cantareus aspersus, Eobania vermiculata, Theba pisana, Helix lucorum). Based on recent studies reviewed here, the use of land snails to map soil genotoxic potential is promising due to their ability to reveal pollution and subsequent environmental risks. Moreover, the position of snails in the trophic chain and the existing bridges between contaminant bioavailability to snails and bioaccessibility to humans reinforce the value of land snail-based ecotoxicological assessment."}
