Biologists may therefore collect samples from polymorphic populations at a number of locations, classify the locations into habitat types, and consider whether the distribution of morphs varies with the habitat. Statistical aspects of this type of study are discussed in this paper. A randomization test for habitat effects is proposed and a negative binomial model is suggested for the distribution of morphs from random locations within one type of habitat. Data on the distribution of Cepaea hortensis and C. nemoralis snails in southern England provide an example. For both species there is clear evidence of differences between habitats, although the morph distributions are rather variable within habitats. The negative binomial model suggests that, for the snail data, variation in morph proportions is mainly due to location differences. The binomial sampling error is relatively unimportant unless the sample size at a location is very small. Therefore it is reasonable to analyse morph proportions by standard methods without giving different weights to data from different locations. The snail data are analysed in this way. Discriminant function analyses are used to test for habitat effects. The relationships between C. hortensis and C. nemoralis morph frequencies within one habitat are examined by a canonical correlation analysis."}
