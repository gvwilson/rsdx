The aim of this study was to describe the inheritance mechanism of the colour variations of the shell and soft parts of this snail, and to study their potential use as a genetic marker. The wild-type phenotype presents dark pigments in the soft parts and in shell bands, whereas the yellow phenotype lacks dark pigments in the soft parts and also most dark bands in the shell, except for a subsutural and a periumbilical band. The data showed that the lack of pigments in A. platae is a recessive homozygotic condition with a simple Mendelian inheritance mechanism. Females of the wild-type phenotype had a higher number of bands than the males. The pigment of the bands of both phenotypes is located in the calcareous matrix of the shell. Using the lack of pigments as a genetic marker we demonstrated the existence of biparental egg masses in A. platae, hitherto known in only one species within the Ampullariidae."}
