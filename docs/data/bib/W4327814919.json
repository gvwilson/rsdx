Field surveys of the land snail fauna of Coolah Tops National Park in 2000â€“2001 and 2018 sampled 28 sites between 556 and 1234 m elevation (Australian Height Datum). Over 1200 specimens in total were collected and were assigned to 29 species or morpho-species in six families. Seven taxa are currently known only from Coolah Tops. Preliminary assessment of five of these concluded they meet IUCN criteria for endangered status. The land snail community of the Coolah Tops highland area is threatened by anthropogenic climate change and is considered to be of outstanding conservation value."}
