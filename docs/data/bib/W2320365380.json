These snails made clear choices of prey and revealed a size-related change in feeding preference. Although occasionally engaging in cannibalism, H. concavum exhibited a marked preference for eggs and hatchlings of A. alternata. The tendency to eat eggs diminished as the snails grew, becoming significantly reduced in snails 6-7 mm in diameter. Additional key words: behavior, cannibalism, egg-cannibalism Although the feeding behavior of an animal is necessarily based on its morphological and physiological adaptations, animals often confront choices among foods, all of which appear to be suitable for consumption. Faced with food choices, many animals exhibit strong preferences (Logue 1991). Carnivorous animals may frequently be faced with a choice which includes conspecifics (Elgar & Crespi 1992). If the normal prey is a species closely related to the predator, the potential for cannibalism may be high. Many carnivorous land snails and slugs eat other land snails and slugs (Watson 1915; Mordan 1977; Cook 1985). Thus they appear to be well adapted for cannibalism. Since some herbivorous snails may engage in egg-cannibalism at hatching (Baur 1992), we wished to determine whether or not the carnivorous land snail Haplotrema concavum SAY 1821 would exhibit strong food preference for or against conspecific eggs and hatchlings. Although the systematics (Baker 1930; Roth 1991), distribution (Hubricht 1985), and mating behavior (Webb 1943) of H. concavum have been the subject of study, the only analysis of the feeding behavior of this species is a test of optimal foraging theory (Pearce & Gaertner, in press), which does not address the question of cannibalism."}
