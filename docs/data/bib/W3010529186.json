Results revealed that the molluscicidal activity of the two tested pesticides oxamyl and methomyl fluctuated from season to another. Autumn and spring seasons exhibited the highest molluscicidal activity against M. cartusiana, while dimethoate noticed the lowest one. On contrary, winter season exhibited the lowest molluscicidal activity for the two tested pesticides (oxamyl and methomyl) comparing with the other two seasons (autumn and spring) while dimethoate gave the lowest one. It could be recommended that control of these snails pests must be carried out during autumn season where few number of snails  were found in the begging of the breeding season. It could not wait to spring season where the numbers of snails reach its maximum values."}
