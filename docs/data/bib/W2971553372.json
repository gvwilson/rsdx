A twelve-week feeding trial was conducted with (n=225 growing snails) with an average weight of 88.95+ 8.10 g to access their growth response and nutrients digestibility. The snails were fed pawpaw leaf meal (PLM), cassava leaf meal (CLM), cassava peel meal (CPM), cassava sieviate meal (CSM) and cassava chaff meal (CCM) in a complete randomized design at 45 snails per treatment of five treatments, while each treatment was replicated three times. The proximate and fiber fractions of the feedstuffs were also determined and data were analyzed using ANOVA. The proximate evaluation showed highest crude protein in PLM (31.35%) and least in CSM (2.34%). The highest crude fiber was obtained for CPM (16.21%) and least in CCM (3.98%) CSM had the highest NFE (87.41%). Highest neutral detergent fiber (NDF) 59.33%, acid detergent fiber (ADF) 34.24%, acid detergent lignin (ADL) (9.18%), cellulose (25.59%) and hemicelluloses 25.06% was obtained for PLM. Outstanding (PL&lt; 0.05%) weekly weight gain, weekly feed intake, nutrient digestibility and carcass yield were obtained in snails on PLM and CLM followed by CPM. Snails utilized Cassava by-product without any adverse effect."}
