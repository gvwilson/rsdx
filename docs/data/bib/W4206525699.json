We found several species with Carpathian distribution, and the study area is probably the easternmost locality of these species. The Humosu Forest Reserve is the fourth locality of Serrulina serrulata (L. Pfeiffer, 1847) in Romania. The species survival requires occurrence of preserved old-growth forests with decaying tree trunks and logs."}
