The highest incorporation was achieved with palmitic acid, although with the other precursors the hydrocarbons were also distinctly labelled. 3. The composition of the hydrocarbons was determined by gas-liquid chromatography, involving a series of n-alkanes (n-C15-n-C37) as the major components (over 83 per cent)."}
