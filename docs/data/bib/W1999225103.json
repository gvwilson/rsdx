Additionally, the growth of the reproductive system was analysed by weekly measurement of body weight, shell length and reproductive system in both laboratory-bred and wild snails of both species. The ovotestis in A. marginata ovum and L. flammea produces oocytes and spermatozoa simultaneously. The five active and two inactive gametogenic stages observed in the two species are described and compared. Genitalia development start after the onset of gametogenesis in both species with the male system developing before the female system. The growth of the albumen gland follows the maturation of the gonad in L. flammea, but in A. marginata ovum the growth is cyclical and seasonal. The first oviposition occurs at approximately 19 months of age in A. marginata ovum and 5 months in L. flammea bred in the laboratory. L. flammea breeds almost throughout the year, whereas this process is restricted to March-October in A. marginata ovum. In L. flammea, the reproductive investment is nearly 200% of parental body weight and the species is estimated to produce 375 young with full size biomass of 1,725 g, while the 140 young produced by A. marginata ovum represent 97% of parental body weight in 3 years and have at full size a biomass of 54,740 g."}
