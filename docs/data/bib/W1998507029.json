Yet, little is known about the life history of rock-dwelling snails. We performed a 30-month mark–release–resight study in four populations of Chondrina clienta (Westerlund, 1883) inhabiting vertical walls of abandoned limestone quarries on the Baltic island of Öland, Sweden, to assess growth rate and survival of juvenile snails and determine age at maturity. We marked 800 individuals ranging in shell height from 1.4 to 4.9 mm, released them in their original habitat, and remeasured their shell height at intervals of 6 months. Shell growth of juvenile C. clienta was affected by the site (quarry wall) and the size of the individual, being highest in medium-sized snails. Shell growth occurred during both summer and winter. Annual apparent survival rates of C. clienta were size-dependent and ranged from 58.6% to 96.3%. Sexual maturity was reached at an age of 5 years, which is later than in most large snail species. Our study extends current knowledge on life history of land snails to a rarely studied group dwelling on rock surfaces."}
