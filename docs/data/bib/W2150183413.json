When snails were classified into two age classes, young adult and old adult, there was a clear mate-choice behaviour in A. fulica. Old adults, which are capable of producing both sperm and eggs, were more favoured as mating partners than young adults which produce only sperm. Size-assortative mating is clear in old adults but not in young adults. This species has two mate-choice criteria which are reproductive stage and body size. The reproductive stage-dependent mate choice is stronger than the body size-dependent mate choice"}
