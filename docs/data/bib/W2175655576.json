The study involved 120 juvenile snails (60/genotype) shared into three replicates of 20 snails each per genotype. Each replicate was housed in a cage measuring 30 x 20 x 24 cm. The animals were provided 8 feed stuffs namely: layers mash (LM), ripped banana fruit (RBF) and peel (RBP), ripped pawpaw fruit (RPF), Telferia occidentalis (TO), poultry dropping (PD), rumen digesta (RD) and a diet containing 10 % rumen digesta (RD10). Animals were fed only during the nocturnal period. Data were collected hourly from 19:30 to 00:30 h each day for 7 days. Results showed significant (p<0.05) differences in the preference of the different feed stuffs by each snail species as well as species differences in feed preferences and time of peak feeding behaviour. The three most appetent feed stuffs were LM, RD10 and PD for A. achatina and LM, RPF and RD10 for A. marginata. Overall, feeding behaviour peaked between 22:30 and 23:30 h in A. achatina and 20:30 and 21:30 h in A. marginata. Snail species should therefore be fed on the most preferred feed stuffs and within the periods of peak feeding behaviour for optimal performance and to minimize wastage."}
