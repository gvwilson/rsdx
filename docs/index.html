<p>When I first began working with scientists
I was puzzled by how little they knew about programming.
I soon realized that they knew far more about it
than I did about galaxy formation,
quantum chemistry,
or protein folding,
and that the principal reason they didn't know more was that
people like me had never taught them.</p>
<p>It took me a longer to understand that
many of the practices I was pushing them to adopt
were a poor fit for their actual problems:
branches in version control aren't designed to manage
dozens of experimental variations on a machine learning algorithm,
and it's hard to write unit tests
when no-one in the world knows what the correct answer is</p>
<p>This tutorial is my latest attempt to teach
a few of the things that I <em>am</em> sure are useful.

<h2>Learner Persona</h2>
<p>Maya has a master's degree in genomics.
She knows enough Python to analyze data from her experiments,
but is struggling to write code other people can use.
These lessons will teach her how to design, build, and test large programs
in less time and with less pain.</p>
