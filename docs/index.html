<h2 id="summary-intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>The best way to learn design is to study examples, and the best programs to use as examples are ones like those you want to create. These lessons therefore build small versions of tools that research software engineers build and use every day to show how experienced software designers think. Along the way, they introduce some fundamental ideas in computer science that many self-taught programmers haven&rsquo;t encountered. The lessons assume readers can write small programs and want to write larger ones, or are looking for material to use in software design classes that they teach.</p>
<h2 id="summary-parse">Parse Raw Data</h2>
<p>Research data is often stored in idiosyncratic formats, or must be extracted from documents that were written for people to read rather than for machines to process. Our first lesson therefore shows how to build a parser that can handle several variations of a single data format and how to write command-line tools that respect <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005412">Taschuk&rsquo;s Rules</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary-plugin">A Plugin Architecture</h2>
<p>Research data may come from files, databases, websites, and many other sources. Instead of rewriting a program each time a new source becomes available, we can build a plugin architecture that loads data handlers dynamically so that users can extend our program without modifying its internals. Doing this gives us an opportunity to look at how to query a SQL database and at the problem of testing visualizations.</p>
<h2 id="summary-refactor">Refactor</h2>
<p>Computational notebooks are a great tool for exploratory work, but research software engineers must also be able to create software libraries that can be re-mixed and re-used. This lesson therefore critiques and refactors a script that uses invasion percolation to simulate to model the spread of pollution to show how to break code up into comprehensible chunks and how to validate implementations against one another.</p>
<h2 id="summary-test">Unit Tests</h2>
<p>Testing research software is hard: the algorithms are often subtle, and we often don&rsquo;t know what the correct output is supposed to be except in a handful of trivial cases. This lesson introduces several tools that can make the problem tractable, including the use of mock objects to make randomness less random and the use of coverage tools to determine what is and isn&rsquo;t being tested.</p>
<h2 id="summary-perf">Measure Performance</h2>
<p>Some pieces of research software have to be fast in order to be useful. This lesson therefore explores how profiling can help us figure out which parts of our program are worth optimizing. Along the way, it alos looks at how to capture program parameters in reproducible ways and why tuning code can&rsquo;t solve fundamental algorithmic issues.</p>
<h2 id="summary-lazy">A Lazy Algorithm</h2>
<p>Simple algorithms are easy to implement and test, but often have poor performance. More complex algorithms—particularly lazy algorithms that don&rsquo;t perform calculations until they&rsquo;re sure the results are needed—are harder to write and test, but can improve performance by orders of magnitude. This lessons demonstrates this idea by implementing a better algorithm for invasion percolation, and along the way shows how to refactor code as needs and ideas evolve.</p>
<h2 id="summary-scale">Scale Up</h2>
<p>Once we have an algorithm that&rsquo;s worth scaling up, we need to actually scale it up. This lesson shows how to describe a workflow as an acyclic graph, how to express that workflow in code to take advantage of cloud computing, and how support tools like logging frameworks and remote data storage can help.</p>
<h2 id="summary-package">A Python Package</h2>
<p>Creating an installable package is the best way to share your code with other people, but Python&rsquo;s packaging tools are a complex mess. This lesson therefore introduces key ideas such as virtual environments and package manifests while avoiding as much of the complexity as it can.</p>
<h2 id="summary-mutate">Synthetic Data</h2>
<p>In this lesson we pivot from simulation to data analysis and build a simple pipeline to find out whether a single nucleotide polymorphism can explain differences in the sizes of snails in polluted regions. We also build a synthetic data generator to help us test our analysis pipeline, and use it to show how data analyses can be tested more generally.</p>
<h2 id="summary-search">Search</h2>
<p>Information is only useful if it can be found, and how we search determines what we find. This lesson shows how to build a simple search engine using a technique called term frequency-inverse document frequency or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">TF-IDF</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary-lims">Laboratory Information Management System</h2>
<p>Every modern lab uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_lab_notebook">Electronic Lab Notebooks</a> (ELNs) to keep track of procedures, experiments, results, and analyses and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_information_management_system">Laboratory Information Management System</a> (LIMS) to share information among team members. This lesson shows how a LIMS works by building a command-line application to store, query, update, and invalidate experimental data.</p>
<h2 id="summary-website">A Static Web Site</h2>
<p>Sharing knowledge is as much a part of research as asking good questions and getting correct answers. This lesson therefore shows how to use a static site generator to create a website that displays research findings, and how to extend such a tool to handle the idiosyncratic needs of a particular research project.</p>
<h2 id="summary-scrape">Scrape Web Data</h2>
<p>Some researchers make their data easy to access and use, but in many other cases, the only way to get information is to scrape it off the web. This lesson therefore explains how the web&rsquo;s basic protocols work, how web pages are represented inside programs, and how to build a tool that can extract information from someone else&rsquo;s HTML.</p>
<h2 id="summary-serve">A Web Service</h2>
<p>As a counterpart to the previous lesson, this one shows how web servers handle requests and generate dynamic HTML pages. Understanding how this works will help research software engineers design services of their own and debug them when things go wrong.</p>
<h2 id="summary-finale">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Software is usually critiqued by asking if it does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do and if it&rsquo;s pleasurable to use. What is often missing is discussion of whether its design makes it easy to manufacture, test, and maintain. We hope these lessons will help you ask and answer that question about the things you build.</p>
