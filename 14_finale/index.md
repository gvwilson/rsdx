# Conclusion

Think about your favorite piece of research software.
You may ask:

- Does it do what it's supposed to?

- Is it comfortable to use?

We should also ask:

- Did its design facilitate its manufacture and maintenance?

We don't have a shared vocabulary and a suite of canonical examples
that would let us critique the design of research software
the way we can the design of a chair or a stapler.
We use words like "elegant",
but quickly run out of meaning when asked to explain what that means.

I hope this book will help us do better.
I hope that some day we'll be able to talk meaningfully about the beauty of software
because it *is* beautiful and we deserve to have ways to say that.
Until then:
