tagline: "What we've covered and where readers might like to go next."
abstract: >
    Software is usually critiqued by asking
    if it does what it's supposed to do and if it's pleasurable to use.
    What is often missing is discussion of
    whether its design makes it easy to manufacture, test, and maintain.
    We hope these lessons will help you ask and answer that question
    about the things you build.
syllabus:
-   Start where you are, used what you have, help who you can.

Think about your favorite piece of research software.
You may ask:

- Does it do what it's supposed to?

- Is it comfortable to use?

We should also ask:

- Did its design facilitate its manufacture and maintenance?

We don't have a shared vocabulary and a suite of canonical examples
that would let us critique the design of research software
the way we can the design of a chair or a stapler.
We use words like "elegant",
but quickly run out of meaning when asked to explain what that means.

I hope this book will help us do better.
I hope that some day we'll be able to talk meaningfully about the beauty of software
because it *is* beautiful and we deserve to have ways to say that.
Until then:
