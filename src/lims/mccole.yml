abstract: >
    Every modern lab uses [Electronic Lab Notebooks][eln] (ELNs)
    to keep track of procedures, experiments, results, and analyses
    and a [Laboratory Information Management System][lims] (LIMS)
    to share information among team members.
    This lesson shows how a LIMS works by building
    a command-line application to store, query, update, and invalidate experimental data.
syllabus:
-   Check the existence, structure, content, and consistency of data in that order.
-   Separate quality control checks from reports.
-   Use models, views, and controllers to build interactive applications.
-   Never pass user data directly in a database query.
