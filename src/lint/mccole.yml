title: "Quality Control"
tag: "Check the integrity and consistency of genome assay data."
abstract: >
    Real data is almost always messy,
    so real-world analysis almost always requires data checking and cleanup.
    This lesson therefore looks at how to build checks on the snail genome assay files
    and how to test those checks.
syllabus:
-   Check the existence, structure, content, and consistency of data in that order.
-   Separate quality control checks from reports.
