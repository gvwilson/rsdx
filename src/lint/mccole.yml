title: "Quality Control"
tag: "Check snail genome assay data for errors."
abstract: >
    Real data is almost always messy,
    so real-world analysis almost always requires data checking and cleanup.
    This lesson therefore looks at how to build checks on the snail genome assay files.
syllabus:
-   Check the existence, structure, content, and consistency of data in that order.
-   Separate quality control checks from reports.
