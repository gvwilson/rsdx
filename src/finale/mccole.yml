    Software is usually critiqued by asking
    if it does what it's supposed to do and if it's pleasurable to use.
    What is often missing is discussion of
    whether its design makes it easy to manufacture, test, and maintain.
    We hope these lessons will help you ask and answer that question
    about the things you build.
syllabus:
-   "Summarize key ideas."
