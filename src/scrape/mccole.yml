title: "Scrape Web Data"
tag: "Pull data from web pages using requests and Beautiful Soup."
abstract: >
    Some researchers make their data easy to access and use,
    but in many other cases,
    the only way to get information is to scrape it off the web.
    This lesson therefore explains how the web's basic protocols work,
    how web pages are represented inside programs,
    and how to build a tool that can extract information from someone else's HTML.
syllabus:
-   How HTTP requests work.
-   Using [requests][requests] to fetch web pages.
-   How HTML is represented as DOM.
-   Using [Beautiful Soup][bs] to parse HTML.
-   Using query selectors to find elements in DOM.
