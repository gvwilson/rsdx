title: "Refactor"
tag: "Refactor a student-quality script that models the spread of pollution."
abstract: >
    Computational notebooks are a great tool for exploratory work,
    but research software engineers must also be able to create
    software libraries that can be re-mixed and re-used.
    This lesson therefore critiques and refactors
    a script that uses invasion percolation to simulate to model the spread of pollution
    to show how to break code up into comprehensible chunks
    and how to validate implementations against one another.
syllabus:
-   Break code into comprehensible chunks.
-   Create classes and class hierarchies.
-   Write docstrings and generating documentation pages.
-   Validate implementations against one another.
