abstract: >
    Information is only useful if it can be found,
    and how we search determines what we find.
    This lesson shows how to build a simple search engine
    using a technique called term frequency-inverse document frequency
    or [TF-IDF][tf_idf].
syllabus:
-   Create a table of term occurrences and calculate TF-IDF scores to support search.
-   Caching the lookup index rather than recalculating it on the fly.
-   Handling different character sets.
-   How the way we clean our data determines the results we get.
