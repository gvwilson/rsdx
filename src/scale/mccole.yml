title: "Scale Up"
tag: "Generate fractals using a workflow runner and store them remotely."
abstract: >
    Once we have an algorithm that's worth scaling up,
    we need to actually scale it up.
    This lesson shows how to describe a workflow as an acyclic graph,
    how to express that workflow in code to take advantage of cloud computing,
    and how support tools like logging frameworks and remote data storage can help.
syllabus:
-   Describing workflows as directed acyclic graphs.
-   Expressing DAGs in code with [Metaflow][metaflow].
-   Use [logging][logging] instead of `print` statements for debugging.
-   Use [DVC][dvc] to store data remotely.
