title: "Build a Web Service"
tag: "Build a small Flask web server to display plate data."
abstract: >
    As a counterpart to the previous lesson,
    this one shows how web servers handle requests and generate dynamic HTML pages.
    Understanding how this works will help research software engineers
    design services of their own
    and debug them when things go wrong.
syllabus:
-   Routing HTTP requests to functions.
-   Separating routing from model.
-   Creating HTML pages from [Jinja][jinja] templates.
-   Serving static files (and what that means).
exclude:
-   static
-   templates
