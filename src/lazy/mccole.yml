title: "A Lazy Algorithm"
tag: "Create a lazy implementation of invasion percolation that's much faster."
abstract: >
    Simple algorithms are easy to implement and test, but often have poor performance.
    More complex algorithms—particularly lazy algorithms
    that don't perform calculations until they're sure the results are needed—are
    harder to write and test,
    but can improve performance by orders of magnitude.
    This lessons demonstrates this idea by implementing a better algorithm for invasion percolation,
    and along the way shows how to refactor code as needs and ideas evolve.
syllabus:
-   Estimating algorithm performance with big-oh.
-   Extending a class hierarchy to accommodate new features.
-   Adapting tools written earlier to make all of this simpler to run, test, and document.
