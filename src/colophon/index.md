-   The tutorial text uses [Atkinson Hyperlegible][atkinson],
    which was designed to be easy for people with impaired vision to read.
    Code uses Source Code Pro and diagrams use Helvetica.

-   The colors in this theme
    are lightened versions of those used in [classic Canadian postage stamps][stamps].
    The art in the title is by [Danielle Navarro][navarro_danielle]
    and used with her gracious permission.

-   The CSS files used to style code were obtained from [highlight-css][highlight_css];
    legibility was checked using [WebAIM WAVE][wave].

-   Diagrams were created with the desktop version of [draw.io][draw_io].

-   The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages][ghp].

-   Traffic statistics are collected using [Plausible][plausible],
    which provides a lightweight ethical alternative to surveillance capitalism.

-   Thanks to the authors of  [Ark][ark],
    [BeautifulSoup][bs4],
    [html5validator][html5validator],
    [pybtex][pybtex],
    [ruff][ruff],
    and all the other software used in this project.
    If we all give a little,
    we all get a lot.
