    The best way to learn design is to study examples,
    and the best programs to use as examples
    are ones like those you want to create.
    These lessons therefore build small versions
    of tools that research software engineers build and use every day
    to show how experienced software designers think.
    Along the way,
    they introduce some fundamental ideas in computer science
    that many self-taught programmers haven't encountered.
    The lessons assume readers can write small programs and want to write larger ones,
    or are looking for material to use in software design classes that they teach.
syllabus:
-   "Assume you know how to program."
-   "Want to learn how to design pieces of software that are reliable and reusable."
-   "Best way is through examples: principles don't make sense unless you know how to translate them into specifics."
exclude:
-   results
