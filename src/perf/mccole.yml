title: "Measure Performance"
tag: "Compare the performance of grid implementations empirically."
abstract: >
    Some pieces of research software have to be fast in order to be useful.
    This lesson therefore explores how profiling can help us figure out
    which parts of our program are worth optimizing.
    Along the way,
    it alos looks at how to capture program parameters in reproducible ways
    and why tuning code can't solve fundamental algorithmic issues.
syllabus:
-   Introduce Python type annotations.
-   Define [dataclasses][dataclasses] to represent parameters for profiling runs.
-   Using [`cProfile`][profile] to determine which parts are expensive.
-   Tuning code does not solve algorithmic problems like quadratic growth in runtime.
