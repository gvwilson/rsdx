title: "Parse Raw Data"
tag: "Turning messy data files into something we can process more easily."
abstract: >
    Research data is often stored in idiosyncratic formats,
    or must be extracted from documents that were written for people to read
    rather than for machines to process.
    Our first lesson therefore shows
    how to build a parser that can handle
    several variations of a single data format
    and how to write command-line tools that respect [Taschuk's Rules][taschuk].
syllabus:
-   Writing command-line tools that respect [Taschuk's Rules][taschuk].
-   Creating a data manifest (and why you want one).
-   Using regular expressions if you have to, but an out-of-the-box parser if one is available.
