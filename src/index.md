      When I first began working with scientists
      I was puzzled by how little they knew about programming.
      I soon realized that they knew far more about it
      than I did about galaxy formation,
      quantum chemistry,
      or protein folding,
      and that the principal reason they didn't know more was that
      people like me had never taught them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took me a longer to understand that
      many of the practices I was pushing them to adopt
      were a poor fit for their actual problems:
      branches in version control aren't designed to manage
      dozens of experimental variations on a machine learning algorithm,
      and it's hard to write unit tests
      when no-one in the world knows what the correct answer is
    </p>
    <p>
      This tutorial is my latest attempt to teach
      a few of the things that I <em>am</em> sure are useful.
