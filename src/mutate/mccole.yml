title: "Search for Mutations"
tag: "Analyze snail genomes to see if a single mutation accounts for size differences."
abstract: >
    In this lesson we pivot from simulation to data analysis
    and build a simple pipeline to find out whether
    a single nucleotide polymorphism can explain differences in
    the sizes of snails in polluted regions.
    We also build a synthetic data generator to help us test our analysis pipeline,
    and use it to show how data analyses can be tested more generally.
syllabus:
-   Use a statistical model of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to synthesize genomic data.
-   Use another model to combine that data with geocoded samples to generate snail sizes.
-   Build a program to analyze and visualize the synthetic data to test the analysis pipeline.
exclude:
-   data
