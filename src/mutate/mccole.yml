title: "Search for Mutations"
tag: "Analyze genomic data from snails in polluted areas to see if a single mutation accounts for differences in sizes."
syllabus:
-   Use a statistical model of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to synthesize genomic data.
-   Use another model to combine that data with geocoded samples to generate snail sizes.
-   Build a program to analyze and visualize the synthetic data to test the analysis pipeline.
exclude:
-   data
